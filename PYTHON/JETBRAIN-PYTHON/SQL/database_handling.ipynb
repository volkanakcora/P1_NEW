    "- Databases are essential for web applications, especially if you want to work with big data. For example, we can use databases for storing information about products in online shops or user data in social networks. Flask doesn't support databases natively, but of course, there are ways to connect our application to the database. Let's find out how.\n",

    "- There are two main approaches for working with databases — raw connections and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). The first one usually interfaces directly with the database by writing and executing queries using the native language supported by the database engine. The second is a programming technology that draws a parallel between SQL and programming language concepts. For example, we can assume databases as classes in"
