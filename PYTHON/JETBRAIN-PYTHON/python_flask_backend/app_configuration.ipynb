You also need to configure the application. It's very important, as you need to indicate the limits of what the app can do. For example, you can allow the server to update the app automatically without restarting it. You can also configure the protection of the data and server from hackers. Let's begin!"

The config attribute of a Flask app is a dictionary. You can enable the development mode like this:\n"
