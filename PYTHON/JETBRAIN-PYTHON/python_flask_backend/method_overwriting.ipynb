In our example, instead of ```super().__init__(name)``` we would write ```super(Child, self).__init__(name)```. Both lines of code mean the same thing: that we want to find the superclass of the class Child and then call its``` __init__ ```method. In Python 3 these are equivalent, so you don't have to explicitly write the type.
