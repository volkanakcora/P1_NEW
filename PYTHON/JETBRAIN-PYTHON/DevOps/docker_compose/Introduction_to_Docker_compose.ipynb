    "Docker Compose is a tool that can define and run multi-container docker applications. It uses a YAML file called docker-compose.yml to define the configuration for your application's services, networks, and volumes. This file can then be used to spin up all of the containers in the application with a single command â€” ```docker compose up```. Similarly, you can use the``` docker compose down``` command to stop and remove the containers created by Docker Compose."
