    "- ```host```:  A host networks is used for standalone containers. It removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host to use the hostâ€™s networking configurations directly. That is, the container doesn't get its own IP address. It uses the host's address. Docker automatically creates a host network and you can't create more.\n",

    "- ```overlay```: : Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons and enable swarm services to communicate with each other.  This strategy removes the need to do OS-level routing between containers. You can create an overlay network via a ```docker network create -d overlay --attachable <network-name>``` command. Note, that you need to initialize a swarm or join a Docker host to an existing swarm. You'll learn about the swarm later on."
