    "Imagine you are investigating a robbery and are trying to figure out what happened. You have witnesses whose testimonies are very vague, but there is no evidence. It will be very difficult to unravel such a mess. If only there were recordings from surveillance cameras to restore the chronology of the events...\n",

    "So now, let's say you are investigating a bug, but what 'surveillance cameras' do you have in that case? Obviously, we need records of everything that happened with the program before the incident. Also, it would be nice to know during which operation it happened. All such records are usually kept in a log. So what is a log?"

    "Logging refers to the act of recording during the execution of an application. Logs are records that give us information about the events in a software application. This record could be a message that is enough to understand the event that happened, it may include a timestamp, a description, and a severity level. These events could be user-generated or system-generated. We use either a log file or, sometimes, the standard output to make these records.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need logging for several reasons. Firstly, it will save a lot of time when we are troubleshooting our application at a later stage. If the program, for example, broke or something went wrong in it, then we can find the exact moment at which the error occurred in the log. This makes the debugging process a lot easier. Secondly, it is also possible to trace who used the program with the log. If it is, say, a site, one can find out who sent the requests. Also, logs help to monitor the operation of a particular system, which makes verification and reporting a whole lot easier. This way, we are always aware of how our programs work and how well they perform.\n",

    "We said earlier that a lot of important information can be added to the log file. But what kind of information is it? There are different types that correspond to the accepted logging levels: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal (from the least critical level to the most critical one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see what those log levels are for.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Debug``` logs are used to diagnose applications. Debugging messages inform us about what the program is doing at a certain step and what it gets as a result of these actions. For example, a message can contain information about the output of some function, so that we can see if it should be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Info``` is used to log important information about an application. It is used to log service start, service stop, configurations, assumptions. For example, the information about the user who has just registered on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Warn``` logs are considered to be the first level of application failure. They are usually applied to log repeated attempts to access a resource, missing secondary data, or switching from a primary server to a back-up server. For instance, there can be a message about a possible disconnection with the server. However, it does not affect the user at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Error``` log level is used for more critical problems. These kinds of issues usually affect the result of the operation but do not terminate the program. Errors are considered to be the second level of application failures. For example, there can be a message that a user could not log in because the database was temporarily unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Fatal``` is the third level of application failures. It is used to indicate a much more serious error that causes the termination of the program. Such a message may say that the program totally failed and depending on the time and conditions of this failure the developers can find out how to fix the problem."
