    "\n",
    "Magic methods are special methods that make using your objects much easier. They are recognizable in the code of the class definitions because they are enclosed in double underscores: for example, __init__ is one of those \"magic\" methods in Python. Since they are characterized by double underscores they are often called dunders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunders are not meant to be invoked directly by you or the user of your class, it happens internally on a certain action. For example, we do not explicitly call the __init__ method when we create a new object of the class, but instead, this method is invoked internally. All we need to do is to define the method inside the class in a way that makes sense for our project.\n",

    "There are many different dunders that you can use, but in this topic, we will focus on the most helpful ones."

    "### 2) __new__ vs __init__\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've been calling __init__ the constructor of the class, but in reality, it is its initializer. New objects of the class are in fact created by the __new__ method that in its turn calls the __init__ method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of the __new__ method is cls. It represents the class itself, similar to how self represents an instance of the class. This also makes __new__ a different kind of method since it doesn't require an instance of the class. This makes sense since it is supposed to create those instances. The method returns a new instance of the class which is then passed to the __init__ method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually, there is no need to define a special __new__ method, but it can be useful if we want to return instances of other classes or restrict the number of objects in our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that we want to create a class Sun and make sure that we create only one object of this class. We would need to define a class variable that would track the number of instances in the class and forbid the creation of new ones if the limit has been reached.\n"
