    "If you spend a lot of time programming, the chances are that you work with different Python versions quite often. That's why you need to install additional packages and modules outside the standard library. Most packages are updated regularly, and there are many versions, older and newer. It can present an issue if you need to maintain an outdated project of yours, as you cannot have two versions of one package at the same time. Another example would be when you want to deploy your code to another machine. How can you make sure that the program will work as planned? The solution is to create a virtual environment. "
