    "- Data is stored on disks under certain addresses. For a computer, such addresses are numbers. It uses them to find the corresponding information. However, humans are not that good at memorizing sets of numbers. It's much easier for us to name our data, for example, family photo, November report, and so on. Therefore, the concept of a file was invented: in a file, one can store some information under a user-friendly name. Let's take a closer look at what files are."

    "Imagine that you're a birdwatcher sitting in the park and counting birds that you see. You've observed a dozen pigeons, 5 sparrows, and even one red crossbill! Now, suppose that you want to store these observations for later use. You need to remember exactly how many birds of each kind you've seen. So, a simple list with numbers won't do because you won't be able to tell which number refers to which bird. You need a data type that can associate one thing with another: in our case, the name of the bird with the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python has such a type — dictionary (dict). You can picture a real dictionary — a large book with definitions for a lot of words. The definition contains two parts: the word itself (let's call it a key) and the definition for it (a value). In our birdwatcher example, the keys are names of the birds (\"pigeon\", \"sparrow\", and \"red crossbill\") and the values are how many birds of that kind we've seen (12, 5 and 1, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, dictionaries work in a similar way: if we want to store an object, we need to select some key for it and put our object as a value for that key into our dictionary."

    "- A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. If you already know the values needed, then the easiest way to create a dictionary is to use the curly braces with a comma-separated list of key: value pairs. If you want to create an empty dictionary, you can do so with the help of curly braces as well. Note that values in a dictionary can be of different types."
