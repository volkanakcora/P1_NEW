    "## Escaping in Regexps\n",
    "You already know that in the language of regular expressions some characters, like the dot and the question mark, have special meaning. This way, the dot will match not only itself, but also almost every other possible character, while the question mark won't match itself at all. But what if we want to use such characters in their literal meaning? What if we want the dot to match nothing but the dot? Well, in this case, escaping comes to our rescue."

    "- ## Escaping through backslashes\n",
    "\n",
    "- - To use a special character in its literal meaning in your regexp, you need to put a backslash \\ before it: \\?, \\.. The backslash \\ is a so-called escape character, it helps symbols to \"escape their work duties\". However, the backslash is used as an escape character not only in regular expressions, but also in Python itself (it is the first character in such escape sequences as \\t and \\n). So, it's possible, though not necessary, to escape the first backslash with another backslash \\ . For example, \\\\? and \\? in the regular expression both correspond to ? in a string, while\\\\. and \\. correspond to a single dot . in a string. Take a look at how it works in practice:"
