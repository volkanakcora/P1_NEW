    "Imagine you've just finished your program and are ready to share it with users and fellow programmers. While working on it, you probably mostly focused on writing code, so a machine would understand what needs to be done and the final program would be executed correctly. However, how will other people know the way your program works, what it can and cannot do, what tasks it's supposed to solve? Most importantly, will you yourself be able to answer all these questions after some time passes? One way to make sure you and others can make use of the program regardless of time and place is to document your code. Let's find out what ways of documenting code are there."

    "Wiki is basically a website that can be edited by multiple users, so it's especially convenient for team projects. Writing a whole wiki is not gonna be easy, so you'll need some tools and recommendations on how to do it. One of the most popular software used for this type of work is MediaWiki. It's a free and open documentation platform that helps you organize the information about your project in a customizable way. Obviously, this format of documentation gives you much more freedom in design and functionality than a simple README file, so you can create a complete and clickable table of contents, add media files, embed code snippets with correct indentation, etc.\n",

    "Release notes and changelogs are specific types of documentation used for informing and keeping track of updates, so it's particularly useful for version control. When something's been changed in the project, you write a release note to inform users and colleagues how exactly this new version differs from the previous one: what's new, what's been fixed, what's deprecated, etc. By writing release notes you will always know at what moment something went wrong or broke, and ask for feedback. Even if you're not planning on publishing these files, it's good practice just to keep these notes for yourself."

    "# Auto-generated documentation\n",
    "There are also external tools that have different functionality that at their core are aimed at helping you with generating documentation for your code. It's important to notice that, for the most part, these tools do not automatically write documentation for you. Since their work is mostly based on the comments embedded in the source code in the first place, they simply convert what's already been written into a more structured and readable form. For example, Doxygen supports many languages and can generate HTML files from source code. Sphinx was originally developed for Python documentation and is ready to help you with building tables, defining document trees, etc. Dr. Explain is a tool for frontend developers, it analyses the user interface of an application and generates documentation in a fast and user-friendly manner. This list is by no means complete, so you can find something for yourself."
