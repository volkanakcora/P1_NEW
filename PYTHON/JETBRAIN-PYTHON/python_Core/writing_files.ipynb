    "# Write to file\n",
    "Well, the first step of writing to a file in Python is, of course, opening the said file for writing. The basic mode for writing is 'w', which allows us to write text to a file. There are a few things we need to pay attention to, though. First, this mode allows us to create new files. This happens when the file we're trying to open doesn't exist yet. Second, if the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten when we open it for writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the file is open, we can use the write() method. file.write() allows us to write strings to a file â€“ other types of data need to be converted to a string beforehand. Let's see it in action."
