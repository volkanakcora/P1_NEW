    "- To begin with, sklearn can be used for various tasks within the data mining process, such as data pre-processing, training machine learning models, and model selection. It is really convenient for machine learning practitioners to have this diverse functionality in one place. Besides, sklearn integrates well with other popular Python libraries useful for data analysis, for example, pandas for storing and manipulating data, numpy for vector computations and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another advantage of sklearn is that this library arguably features all widely-used algorithms for the most common machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, etc. Whichever algorithm you want to use with your data, most likely, you will find it inside sklearn. Convenient, right?\n",
    "- Part of its success is also due to a simple intuitive interface. Fitting any ML model in sklearn is very simple, even if you know almost nothing about machine learning. Moreover, the interface is consistent, so your code will look more or less the same, whether you are solving a classification, regression, or a clustering problem. The same goes for data preprocessing techniques.\n"

    "The major downside is speed. The sklearn implementation of the machine learning algorithms cannot compete in speed with their lower-level implementations (for example, in C++). So, if speed is an important factor for your project, or if you are working with really big datasets, you may want to use other tools. However, sklearn could still be useful for quick proof of concept on a smaller portion of the data."
