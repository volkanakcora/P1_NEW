    "\n",
    "- - Lastly, there is another quite important parameter, `stratify`, which ensures that the train and test sets will be representative of the class distribution in the original dataset, which becomes crucial when dealing with an unequal class distribution. Without setting the stratify (None by default) to an array of labels, you might end up in a scenario where certain classes are only present in either the train or the test set. The following line ensures that both the train and the test will have the same ratio of classes as the original set:"
