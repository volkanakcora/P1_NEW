    "-  Python tool called generator. Its implementation looks quite similar to the things you already know (like function and list comprehension), so it won't be hard to master, but definitely worth it since generators have quite a few tricks up their sleeve you might find very useful in practice. Let's not waste time any more and get to know them better!"
