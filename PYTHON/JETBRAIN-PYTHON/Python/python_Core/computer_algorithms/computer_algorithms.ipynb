    "An important difference between real-life and computer algorithms is that a computer cannot guess what we intend to do. If something goes wrong or an algorithm is not clear, a human can adjust the algorithm based on their experience. Computers cannot do the same. Let's get back to our sandwich algorithm. If we realize that we are out of bread, a human would think of going to the store and buying some more. On the other hand, a computer would report the absence of such an ingredient or proceed with its work without even noticing that, which would result in incorrect output. Thus, it is our responsibility to describe a computer algorithm precisely and unambiguously."

The difference between programs and algorithms is that programs are written using a specific programming language while algorithms are usually described at a higher level than programming language statements. In other words, an algorithm is like an abstract schema, and a program can be its implementation.\n",

    "- Programming languages usually contain implementations of some basic algorithms for solving typical problems. These algorithms are provided in standard libraries, and software developers can reuse them instead of implementing a new one each time. However, to be able to use such algorithms correctly and efficiently and to understand how other developers use them, it is essential to learn these basic algorithms and get familiar with how they work under the hood. Moreover, the methods and tricks used in these approaches may come in handy while building your own algorithms as well. It is similar to solving exercises at school: these here are the examples you solve with your teacher during the class, and at home you have to solve other tasks using the methods discussed during the lesson.\n",
