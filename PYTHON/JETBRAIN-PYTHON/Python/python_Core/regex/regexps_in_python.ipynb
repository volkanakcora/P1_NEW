    "# Regexps in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a sequence of characters defining a search pattern, that is, a pattern describing a set of strings. These patterns are used for searching and editing text, replacing one substring with another, and so on. The simplest example of using a regular expression is when we search for some word in a text file or on a web page. For example, if we look for the word \"python\", the string \"python\" becomes a simple regular expression â€” a search pattern that corresponds only to the word \"python\" and nothing else. More complicated regular expressions will be able to match a larger number of strings.\n",
