If you try to open too many files at once, depending on your operating system, you may get an error or completely crash your program.\n",

    "This works perfectly fine if we have relatively simple programs. However, as our programs or our file manipulations get more complicated, determining when and how to close the files may get tricky. In other programming languages, a common way to deal with this is a try ... except ... finally block. In Python, we can use a context manager. Basically, the context manager guarantees that all necessary operations will take place at the right time. In the example with opening files, the context manager will close the file and release the file descriptor when we are done working with the file."
