    "MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern separating an application into three logical components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model is responsible for all data and its related logic;\n",
    "View is responsible for presenting data to users or handling user interaction;\n",
    "Controller informs the Model of the need for changes.\n",
    "In order to understand how to work with these components, consider the example below."

    "When the user clicks on interface elements, they interact with the Controller. The Controller accepts user input and interacts with the Model. The Model represents the state of an application. It can be data in a database, a file, an in-memory data, or something else. After modification, the Model updates the View, and its user sees this."
