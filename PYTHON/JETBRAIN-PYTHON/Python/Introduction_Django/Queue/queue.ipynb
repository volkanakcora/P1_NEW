It is understandable that a lot of customers immediately came running, forming a queue. To speed up the process, the store manager asks the person in line about their foot size, enters this information into the computer and gives the person a piece of paper with their number in the queue"

    "Queue is a linear data structure that implements the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, meaning that new elements can be added to the back of the queue, while removing an element is only possible from its head. Queue is really just like any real-life line in a supermarket: customers who come first are attended first, while the others are waiting for their turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically queue supports the following two basic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```enqueue```, that adds a new element to the back of the queue\n",
    "- ```dequeue```, that removes the first element of the queue.\n",
    "Sometimes, operations front and rear are also supported. They return the first and the last element of the queue respectively without removing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, queues are especially useful in threaded programming when information must be exchanged between multiple threads. Queues are at the heart of job schedulers, helping to schedule delayed tasks efficiently while preserving the order in which they must be performed."

The essential methods are ```append(element)``` and ```appendleft(element)```, which add a new element to the right or left side of the deque respectively, as well as ```pop()``` and ```popleft()```, which remove the first element from the corresponding side of the deque."
