    "As you already know, Django web applications can access and manage data with Python objects â€” models. Models specify the structure of the stored data. The model definition must not depend on the selected database because once you choose the database you want to use in your project, you don't have to work with it directly. You write your model structure, and Django does all the work related to the database. There are many different types of models. In this topic, we will take a closer look at the most common ones: DecimalField, FloatField, IntegerField, BooleanField, CharField, TextField, DateField and FileField.\n",
