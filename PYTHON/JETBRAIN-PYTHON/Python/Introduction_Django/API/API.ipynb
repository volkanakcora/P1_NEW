Class-Based Views, found in many web frameworks like Django, are one solution. They streamline common tasks and make our code more reusable, proving particularly beneficial in larger projects.\n",

Stay tuned to discover how Class-Based Views can transform your web development experience and make handling APIs a breeze."
