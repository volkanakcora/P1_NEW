    "# Serializers in DRF\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, serialization is a way to convert data from source to target data structure so the end client can comprehend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deserialization is the opposite process of converting data to a format that will be understood by a source from the data sent by the end client.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a conversation between two people who speak two very different languages — Bengali and Russian. How can they possibly communicate? They can get help from an interpreter who understands both Bengali and Russian. When Bengali says something, and the statement is translated to Russian — it's serialization. And when the Russian says something and the reply is translated to Bengali — it's deserialization. The interpreter, in this case, is the serializer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When communicating over an API, we serialize internal data into a commonly used language like JSON or XML. And then, we also deserialize data from JSON or XML into our internal data structures. Nowadays, however, thanks to its convenience, everyone opts for JSON in API communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django Rest Framework serializes Python objects into JSON data to send it back to the client. In most cases, it is based on Javascript. DRF serializers are very similar to Django Form and Django ModelForm classes."

It uses indentation, lists, and dictionaries to structure data. Additionally, it supports various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, dates, times, nulls, and even executable code. Another advantage of YAML is that it requires fewer characters and tokens to represent data than JSON, saving memory and time."
