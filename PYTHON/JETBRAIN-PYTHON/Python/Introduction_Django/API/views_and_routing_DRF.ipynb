    "- When we interact with a website, our requests are captured by a URL pattern in Django and then forwarded to Django views to handle. After that, the view determines what to return as a response to the user. Yes, the DRF API views are very similar to Django views. The main difference is that we return HTML data in Django views, while in DRF API views, we return JSON data. As you probably know, URLs and Views are the most critical parts of a Django project"

    "## Views\n",
    "When building APIs with Django, one cannot help but appreciate the elegance and power of Class-Based Views (CBVs). Before diving into the more sophisticated world of Django Rest Framework (DRF), it is worthwhile to understand how you can employ basic CBVs to add API endpoints to your application. Let's take a simple example to illustrate this. Suppose you have a Django project and must create a basic API for a list of products. Using a CBV approach without DRF, you can define a view class, inherit from Django's View class, and write methods for HTTP verbs like GET and POST to handle requests and return responses. Let's create simple function-based and class-based views as an example:"

This is where DRF comes to the rescue, streamlining the process and providing powerful tools for building APIs efficiently.

For example, to return a list of Article objects, we can create a ListAPIView by extending the generics.ListAPIView class:"
