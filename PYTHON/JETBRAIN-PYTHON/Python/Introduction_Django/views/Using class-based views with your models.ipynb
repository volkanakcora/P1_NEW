    "# Using class-based views with your models\n",
    "Class-based views (CBVs) in Django are a method for structuring views using Python classes. They provide a more structured and extensible way to create views. CBVs are commonly used in Django for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database models. For instance, when you are building a blog application, you can use Class-based views to create new blog posts effortlessly. Users submit a form, and the CBV handles the database insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of Objects\n",
    "ListView is a view class that Django offers, which is useful when you want to display a list of model objects in the form of an HTML page. This view class is commonly used for making pages that display lists of items from the database. Examples can include blog posts, articles, and various store items. For example, in our \"Football\" project, we'll be using ListView to display a list of all soccer players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say you want to display a list of all the players stored in our database. For this, all we need to do is define the FootballerListView in the views.py file for the \"Team\" app.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.views.generic import ListView\n",
    "from .models import Footballer\n",
    "\n",
    "class FootballerListView(ListView):\n",
    "    model = Footballer\n",
    "    template_name = 'templates/footballer_list.html'\n",
    "    context_object_name = 'footballers'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The model Footballer that the view will work with is defined using the model attribute. The template_name attribute indicates the HTML template file used to render the view. In our case, it's 'templates/footballer_list.html'. Your template might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n",
    "\n",
    "{% block content %}\n",
    "  <h2>List of footballers</h2>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    {% for footballer in footballers %}\n",
    "      <li>{{ footballer.name }}: {{ footballer.position }}</li>\n",
    "    {% empty %}\n",
    "      <li>No footballers available.</li>\n",

    "The context_object_name attribute sets the name under which the list of footballers will be available in the template. If the context_object_name is not specified in the ListView, Django will automatically create a name for the context variable based on the name of the model to which the ListView is bound. This name will be generated by converting the model name to lowercase and adding \"_list\" at the end. Additionally, Django always adds a default context variable called 'object_list' to the template, which contains the list of objects. For example, if you have a ListView that works with the Product model and you have not specified a context_object_name, the default context variable for the list of objects will be named 'product_list', and 'object_list' will also be available in the template for the same list of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open FootballerListView in Django, it uses the footballer_list.html template to display a list of footballers on the webpage. However, you also need to configure the URL route for the FootballerListView view. To do this, you need to add some code in the urls.py file for the \"Team\" application (team/urls.py), :\n",
