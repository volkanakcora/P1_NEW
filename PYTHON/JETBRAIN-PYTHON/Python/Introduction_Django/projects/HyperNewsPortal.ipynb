    "## HyperNews Portal: Stage 4 - Creating New Articles (ipynb format)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, news articles are stored in a JSON file, making adding new entries inconvenient. This stage involves creating a web interface to simplify the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a form page:** This page will allow users to submit new articles using a form with title and text fields.\n",
    "2. **Handle form submission:**\n",
    "    - Upon form submission (POST request to `/news/create/`), the view function should:\n",
    "        - Read the existing JSON data.\n",
    "        - Verify unique links for new articles.\n",
    "        - Extract title and text from the submitted form.\n",
    "        - Set the `created` date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.\n",
    "        - Add the new article data to the JSON.\n",
    "    - Redirect the user back to the main page after successful submission.\n",
    "3. **Accessibility:**\n",
    "    - The form page should include a link back to the main page (`/news/`) with `target=\"_blank\"` for opening in a new tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the three main components: creating the form template, handling form submission in the view, and defining the URL pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Form Template (HTML):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n",
    "  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "  <title>HyperNews - Create Article</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "  <h1>Create New Article</h1>\n",
    "  <form action=\"{% url 'news:create_article' %}\" method=\"post\">\n",
    "    {% csrf_token %}  <label for=\"title\">Title: </label>\n",
    "    <input id=\"title\" type=\"text\" name=\"title\" required>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <label for=\"text\">Text: </label>\n",
    "    <textarea id=\"text\" name=\"text\" rows=\"10\" cols=\"50\" required></textarea>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add Article\">\n",
    "  </form>\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <a href=\"{% url 'news:index' %}\" target=\"_blank\">Back to Main Page</a>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The template defines a form with fields for title and text.\n",
    "- The `action` attribute specifies the URL for handling form submission (`/news/create/`).\n",
    "- The `method` attribute is set to `post` as the form submits data.\n",
    "- `{% csrf_token %}` includes a CSRF token for security.\n",
    "- A link redirects users back to the main page using the `url` template tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. View Function (Python):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.shortcuts import render, redirect\n",
