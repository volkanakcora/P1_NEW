    "When defining your models in Django, you may want users to select one of the available options. For this, you can use the CharField option.\n",

    "```\n",
    "class Cat(models.Model):\n",

    "    PERSIAN = 'PE'\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "You run a small bike shop with a few very fancy bike models. You think your shop could benefit from a simple website where your customers could check out the available bikes and order the one that catches their eye. Besides, your employees will appreciate a tool that could help them keep track of the orders and bike parts with the admin panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your employees also make custom bikes from various bike parts; some parts can be used for several models, for example, certain tire types, different seats, and frames. Let's start with the website, step by step!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "Let's start with the database by defining data models. Your first task is to create the models and define their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a bike, you need a frame, seat, and tires; some bikes have a basket. Further, you need a separate database table where you can store information on the orders of your beloved customers. Your task is to define the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frame — This model should have two fields: color (CharField) and quantity (IntegerField);\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seat — the same fields as above;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tire — this model should have two fields: type (CharField) and quantity (IntegerField);\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basket — only one field: quantity (IntegerField) as you're going to use only one type of basket for all bikes;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bike — this model is linked with the ones above. After all, a bike consists of all these elements; you need three fields that serve as foreign keys to the relevant models: frame, tire, and seat. Make sure you also have the name (CharField), description (TextField), and has_basket (BooleanField);\n",
    "\n",
    "- Order — this model requires fields such as bike (ForeignKey), name, surname, and phone_number — all CharFields. Another field is status. It should be CharField and accept only one letter: either P for \"pending\" or R for \"ready.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to migrate the models to the database!"

    "Admin panel and main view\n",
    "Description\n",
    "We have the database up and running; it's time to fill it with data on your shop's bikes! The staff needs the admin panel where they can add all the relevant information on available bikes and parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be best if you also started working on the actual website. Perhaps, having the main page with all the available bikes would make a good start?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the admin panel! First, you need to register all the models in the admin.py file. Once you've done it, it's time to create a superuser — use the username, email address, and password of your choice. Next, log in to the admin panel (it should be available at localhost:8000/admin/) and add some data. Remember to start with frames, seats, tires, and available baskets. After this, build some bikes out of the available components. Adding 2-3 cycles of different frame colors, seats, and tire types is a good idea. Add some variations with baskets; it will make the testing easier in the later stages. Please don't add any orders for now; they are for later stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make your admin panel more user-friendly and display the name of your bike instead of Bike object (1), use the __str__() method. You can read more on the method in the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be great to see the bikes listed nicely on the website, wouldn't it? Let's draw up such a page. Create a dedicated view, the urls.py file, with relevant content and add a template. The page should be available at localhost:8000/bikes/. There is only one requirement on how the page should look — all the bikes from the database should be displayed as separate elements of the unordered list; all the rest is up to you. Check the screenshot below as a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "- Add the admin panel and create the superuser;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add some bike parts and build some custom bikes;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create the url.py file with a dedicated view and list the bikes as separate elements of the unordered list.\n",
