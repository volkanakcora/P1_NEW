    "The advantage of a framework is that all its parts can interact with each other easily. Do you remember that Django is based on the Model-View-Template architecture? It consists of the model, which defines the data structure, the view, which handles the logic and interaction with the user, and the template, which controls the presentation and rendering of the data. In addition, we have forms to collect information from users. Let's see it in action — process and pass data from the database to our HTML templates and get it from HTML forms to save to the database.\n",
