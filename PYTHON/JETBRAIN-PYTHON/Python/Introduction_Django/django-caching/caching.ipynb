    "# Django Caching Framework is what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django allows caching the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local memory cache\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database cache\n",
    "\n",
    "- File system cache\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memcached\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Memory Caching\n",
    "\n",
    " Django uses a local memory caching backend. This method stores cached data in the RAM where your Django application runs. It's quick and is an excellent choice for your local development or testing environment. The disadvantage of local memory caching is its inability to scale beyond a single server. It works best with a single Django instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django, you can configure local memory caching using the built-in backend django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache. Add the code below to your project's settings.py file to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CACHES = {\n",
    "   'default': {\n",
    "      'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',\n",
    "      'LOCATION': 'bookstore_cache',\n",
    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The cache LOCATION denotes the memory stores. If you only have one locmem cache, the LOCATION variable is not necessary. But, if you have multiple local memory caches, name at least one of them to differentiate them."

    "## Database Caching\n",
    "Your store is growing with an increasing number of customers and books, and you wish to limit the number of database queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database caching stores the cache results in your existing database. It is the simplest but not the best way to cache your Django app. It uses your app's existing database, thereby increasing the overall database load.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, this method has its challenges. You might face performance issues with large amounts of data. Operating system restrictions could limit the number of files. In a distributed environment, sharing this cache needs additional solutions. Existing data management and security also need attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "File system cache provides a reliable space to store data, but it may not be suitable for high-load scenarios. In such cases, Memcached can help."

For instance, if your bookstore application includes dynamic pages, frequently updated data, or high user personalization levels, site-wide caching becomes preferable."

    "\n",
    "Rather than using an expensive caching level that wastes memory space, you can cache a specific view. It's an efficient way to incorporate caching in your Django app. For example, you could cache a welcome page unique to each user. Use the cache_page decorator that comes with Django either directly on the view function or the path within URLConf. It's straightforward to set up and use.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As the view mapped to your URL takes parameters, each different request from end users will be cached separately. For example, a request to /user/James/Brown will be different from /user/Charles/Ugo.\n",
