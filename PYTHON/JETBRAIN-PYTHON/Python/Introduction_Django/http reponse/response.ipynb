    "## Django HttpResponse class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HttpResponse` class is part of the `django.http` module and is used to handle text responses for HTTP requests in Django. It's a common return value from Django view functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike automatically created `HttpRequest` objects, you create `HttpResponse` objects manually in your views.\n",
    "* An `HttpResponse` object can contain various content types like text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos.\n",
    "* It has three main aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Status code:** A three-digit number representing the HTTP response status (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).\n",
    "    * **Content:** The data returned to the client (text, HTML, JSON, etc., converted to a string).\n",
    "    * **Headers:** Additional information about the response (e.g., content type, cookies).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating an HttpResponse Object:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    return HttpResponse('Hello HttpResponse')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Content Incrementally:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    response = HttpResponse()\n",
    "    response.write(\"<p>Hello, World!</p>\")\n",
    "    response.write(\"<p>Hello, World Wide Web II!</p>\")\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting Headers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    response = HttpResponse()\n",
    "    response['Name'] = 'Andrei'\n",
    "    response['Location'] = 'some location'\n",
    "    del response['Location']  # Unlike dictionaries, won't raise an error for non-existent headers\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using HttpResponse.headers (Django 3.2+):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    response = HttpResponse()\n",
    "    response.headers['Name'] = 'Andrei'\n",

    "    del response.headers['Location']\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Important Attributes and Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.content`: Returns the response content as a byte string.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.charset`: Specifies the character encoding for the content.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.status_code`: Sets or gets the HTTP status code.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.closed`: True if the response is closed, False otherwise.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse['Content-Type']`: Sets or gets the MIME type of the content.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.set_cookie()`: Sets a cookie on the client's browser.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.delete_cookie()`: Deletes a previously set cookie.\n",
    "* `HttpResponse.__init__()`: Initializes an `HttpResponse` object with content, content type, and other options.\n",

    "Django HttpResponse class\n",
    "Django HttpResponse class is a part of the django.http module; it handles a text response of an HTTP request. This class is most frequently used as a return object from the Django view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike automatically created HttpRequest objects, HttpResponse objects are developed manually. Each view you write for your Django app is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an HttpResponse object with the content of the requested page or raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content like images, videos, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are HttpResponse objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we add the path for the view inside the urls.py file:\n",
    "\n",
    "# first we need to import the view function\n",
    "from responses import http_response\n",

    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "The HttpResponse class has three main aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "The status code is a three-digit number representing the HTTP response's status. It tells the client whether the request was successful and, if not, what went wrong. Django provides a list of standard HTTP status codes that can be used with the HttpResponse class, such as 200 for OK or 404 for Not Found. You can set the status code in the constructor of the HttpResponse class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content is the data that will be returned to the client as part of the HTTP response. This can be any data converted to a string, such as text, HTML, or JSON. You can set the content in the constructor of the HttpResponse class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we have a Django app named responses . We create the view function http_response inside the views.py file in our app:\n",
    "\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    return HttpResponse('Hello HttpResponse') \n",
    "\n",
    "The HttpResponse class passes the page's content as a string or a byte string to the constructor. To add the content to the page incrementally, the response can be used as a file-like object:\n",
    "\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    response = HttpResponse()\n",

    "    response.write(\"<p>Hello, World Wide Web II!</p>\")\n",
    "    return response\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The HttpResponse class can also be used to set a header in the response object. Using the response object as a dictionary, we can manipulate header fields. In other words, we can add or delete headers of the response object:\n",
    "\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def http_response(request):\n",
    "    response = HttpResponse()\n",

    "    response['Location'] = 'some location'\n",
    "    del response['Location']\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in dictionaries, the del command can delete a non-existing header in objects. It won't raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use newlines in the HTTP header fields. If you try to set a header with newline characters, Django will raise a BadHeaderError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with Django 3.2, developers added the HttpResponse.headers attribute. This attribute is a case-insensitive dictionary-like object that provides an interface to all HTTP headers of the response object:\n",

    "\n",
    "HttpResponse attributes and methods\n",
    "Like any other class, HttpResponse has many attributes and methods. Django does a lot of work when you use this class, but it is worth mentioning some of its attributes and methods that can be used for advanced manipulation of the response object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among HttpResponse attributes, it is worth mentioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.content returns the content of the response as a byte string;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.charset specifies the character encoding used to interpret the response content;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.status_code sets or gets the HTTP status code for the response (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found);\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.closed is True if the response has been closed and False, if otherwise;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse['Content-Type'] sets or gets the MIME type of the response content;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.set_cookie() sets a cookie on the client's browser;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.delete_cookie() deletes a cookie previously set on the client's browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most valuable methods of the HttpResponse class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.__init__(content=‚Äù\", content_type=None, status=200, reason=None, charset=None) instantiates an HttpResponse object with the page content and content type;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.__setitem__(header, value) sets the provided header name to the value;\n",

    "HttpResponse.__delitem__(header) deletes a header with the provided name;\n",
    "\n",
    "HttpResponse.__getitem__(header) returns the value of the header name;\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. HttpResponse:**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. HttpResponseForbidden:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This subclass returns the `403 Forbidden` status code. It indicates the server understands the request but won't authorize it, often used for access restriction:\n",

    "* An absolute path without a domain (e.g., /search/)\n",
    "* A relative path (the browser will reconstruct the full URL based on the current path)\n",
