    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Hangman is a popular, funny, yet very grim game. A cruel computer hides a word from you and you need to guess it, letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be hanged, if you win, you'll survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably familiar with the rules; now you can create this game yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a brief look at what you are going to build in this project. Here is what the gameplay will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main menu, players can choose to either play or exit the game;\n",
    "If players choose to play, the computer picks a word from a list — it will be the answer;\n",
    "The computer asks players to enter a letter that may or may not be in the word;\n",
    "If players suggest a letter that does not appear in the word for the first time, It's a miss. A player can miss 8 times before the game is over;\n",
    "If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the players. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on;\n",
    "When the entire word is uncovered — it's a victory! The game should calculate the final score and return to the main menu.\n",
    "This may sound complex, but the project is split into small stages with the hints that will guide you. We guarantee that the final product is replayable and quite engaging!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an announcement that will greet the player. You already know how to print with Python. Apply that knowledge to entice your friends to play with an announcement for your game!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "In this stage, write a program that prints the lines shown in the example below.\n",

Players should now guess the letters in a word instead of inputting an entire word. If an attempt is successful, uncover the letter. We also need to add the lose condition — players have eight attempts to guess all letters that appear in the word. When players run out of attempts, the game ends.\n",

    "Your game should work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players have exactly eight attempts to guess the word by entering letters one by one. Asking for a letter, print: Input a letter:. If a player uncovered all the letters, but some attempts are still left, the - - - program must continue to ask for input until all the tries are exhausted;\n",
    "- If the letter doesn't appear in the word, the computer takes one try away – even if a user has already suggested this letter – and prints That letter doesn't appear in the word.;\n",
    "- If the letter does appear in the word but a user has already suggested this letter and it's open, no need to print any messages;\n",
    "- If all attempts are exhausted, the game ends; the program shows a final message (Thanks for playing!). Otherwise, players can continue to input letters;\n",
    "- We continue to stick with the word list from the previous stage: python, java, swift, javascript. It ensures that your program is tested reliably. Don't worry about javascript. Yes, it's longer than 8 characters, but we'll keep it in the list for consistency since we're not done with developing the game yet and for now there is no win or lose.\n"
