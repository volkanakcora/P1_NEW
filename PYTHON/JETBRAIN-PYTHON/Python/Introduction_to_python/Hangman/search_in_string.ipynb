    "## A substring searching algorithm\n",
    "We'll start with a substring searching problem. Given two strings, text and pattern, we need to identify whether there is at least one occurrence of the pattern in the text. The simplest and most natural way to solve this problem is to sequentially consider all substrings of the text whose length is equal to the length of the pattern and compare them with the pattern itself. If at least in one case all corresponding symbols match, the pattern is found. If none of such attempts were successful, we should indicate that there is no pattern in the text. Here's how this simple algorithm can be implemented in Python:\n",
