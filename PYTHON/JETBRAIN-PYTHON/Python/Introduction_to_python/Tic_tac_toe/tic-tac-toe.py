#It is highly recommended to state clearly what type of input we expect from our users. To do so, the input() function may take an optional argument, that is, a message:

user_name = input('Please, enter your name: ')
print('Hello, ' + user_name)

#Description
#Our program should be able to display the grid at all stages of the game. Now we're going to 
# write a program that allows the user to enter a string representing the game state and correctly prints
# the 3x3 game grid based on this input. We'll also add some boundaries around the game grid.
