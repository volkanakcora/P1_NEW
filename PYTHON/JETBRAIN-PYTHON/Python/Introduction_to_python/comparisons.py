Comparison or relation operations let you compare two values and determine the relation between them. There are ten comparison operators in Python:

"<" strictly less than
"<=" less than or equal
">" strictly greater than
">=" greater than or equal
"==" equal
"!=" not equal
"is" object identity
"is not" negated object identity
"in" membership
"not in" negated membership.


#Logic & arithmetics
Let's look at another interesting case. At the beginning of the topic, we learned that the result of applying comparison operators is always bool. 
#However, if there is a logical and arithmetic part in an expression, we might see unusual behavior due to logical operators in Python being short-circuited, or lazy:
