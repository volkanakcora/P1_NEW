    "\n",
    "We are going to create a program that keeps track of the learning progress of multiple students. To accomplish this task, we should teach our program to read various data in string and numeric formats, do certain calculations, and output desired information. To begin with, we need to make our program interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any program designed to interact with users should have a user interface. In our case, we will implement the command-line interface so that users can enter different commands and receive the corresponding responses. In addition, for the benefit of our users, we will make commands case-insensitive and keep our responses reasonably informative.\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's add new functionality to our program by making it read the user credentials and verify whether they are correct or not. Every user must provide the following credentials: their first and last name and a valid email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The email address format is defined in RFC standards and is very complicated. In reality, email addresses are usually verified by sending a verification letter to which the user is required to reply and confirm the validity of the address. So in general, it is feasible just to check whether the provided string looks like an email address. It should contain the name part, the @ symbol, and the domain part.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking names is even more intricate. We are not going to require users' photo ID and similar stuff, but take into your account that a learning platform may issue personal certificates of accomplishment, so it would not make any sense to issue a certificate with a name like ~D0MInAt0R~.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to put several limitations on the personal name format. First, users should state their full names that include the first and the last name. Accept only ASCII characters, from A to Z and from a to z as well as hyphens - and apostrophes '. For example, Jean-Claude and O'Neill are valid names, but Stanisław Oğuz is not. We respect every student, but we kindly request them to write their names using English-alphabet letters only.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the first part of the full name before the first blank space is the first name, and the rest of the full name should be treated as the last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A name may contain one or more hyphens and/or apostrophes, but don't allow them as the first or the last character of any part of the name. Also, these characters cannot be adjacent to each other. The first name and the last name must be at least two characters long \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Recognize a new command: add students and respond with the following message: Enter student credentials or 'back' to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Recognize a new back command and react as follows: if users want to finish adding new students, the program should print a message with the total number of students added during the session, for example: Total 5 students have been added. Otherwise, print a hint: Enter 'exit' to exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- - The program should read user credentials from the console and check whether they match the established patterns. If the credentials match all patterns, print The student has been added. Otherwise, it should print which part of the credentials is not acceptable: Incorrect first name, Incorrect last name and Incorrect email.\n",
    "\n",
    "- - If the input cannot be interpreted as valid credentials, the program should print Incorrect credentials.\n",
