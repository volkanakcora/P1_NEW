Yes, those users were suspended, that's correct, but it technically means an inability to get into the M7 (core, enquiry,...) but every request comes through the Rabbit MQ messaging system, which is (in terms how the requests flow) placed before the place where you blocked them. Basically if there is an API/algotrader who does not handle the failed logins correctly and only creates new and new sessions even when it fails to get into the system, then in this case the defense by user suspension does not work, as can be seen is this case. Nonetheless I see no self healing messages since 03:43.

M7 API - HABITAT/LIGER - does AMQP respect the order of sent requests?,SERVICE-11099,114441,Customer Service Request,Closed,SERVICE,Energy Service Desk,service_desk,sw455,Consolidated Energy IT Service Desk for ALL customer and internal usage,https://servicedesk.deutsche-boerse.com,Minor,Resolved,wn626,jm.pournin@epexspot.com,jm.pournin@epexspot.com,02/Sep/21 13:47,08/Sep/21 13:47,16/Sep/21 13:42,03/Sep/21 10:11,,7tops_sprint125,,,,,,"dear support,

LIGER has a question about the order with which they send their order management requests and the order in which M7 will process these requests: does AMQP guarantees that requests will be executed in the same order?
(all requests coming from the same API app/same API user/private request exchange:

Example : all orders actions below are sent via the same API app/API user/private request exchange: 
- request_1 : buy order hibernation request 
- request_2: asap after having sent request_1: send a sell order price modification request 

Can they be sure that M7 will process request_1 and THEN request 2 if both requests are sent one after another? (being understood that request 1 could fail for any reason)

Business case: they want to put in place a cross trade protection.
They happen to have several orders on the very same order book, like 1 buy order and 1 sell order, managed by independent trading strategies in the same app.
One of their trading strategy managing the sell order might decide to sell at a price below their buy order price.
In order to avoid a cross trade, they would like to temporarily hibernate the buy order and change the sell order price.
Can they achieve this without risking the sell order to be modified before the buy order gets hibernated if their app sends both requests one after another and does not wait for the buy order hibernation Order Execution Report (or Ack Resp)?

The short answer is no, the AMQP itself doesn't guarantee anything. If you send the requests in some order, it's not guaranteed that they will arrive there in the same order (network etc...). The management requests are queued on the AMQP server, and what we already guarantee is that M7 will process them in this order (the order in the queue). It is stated also in DFS180: “The M7 system guarantees that it will *process request messages* from a client *in the order in which the messages have been delivered* to the queue on the *AMQP server*.”
 
You will still need to wait for AckResp

STATKRAFT reports that ""Since the deployment of the M7 6.11 release, we regularly see M7 application heartbeats stopping after about 30 min. Yesterday, this started happening after a reconnect triggered from our side at 2pm and lasted precisely until midnight. Looking at our logs from the past months, this has only started happening now after the new release. The last respective log line from our system is:

We have observed a similar behaviour in ASIM but attributed it to a worse general availability of this environment.

M7 API PROD - GOLDMAN SACHS/JAREX - app start: random but repeated req sending failures (Contract Info Request ),SERVICE-10982,113893,Problem,Closed,SERVICE,Energy Service Desk,service_desk,sw455,Consolidated Energy IT Service Desk for ALL customer and internal usage,https://servicedesk.deutsche-boerse.com,Minor,Not a Bug,wn626,jm.pournin@epexspot.com,jm.pournin@epexspot.com,18/Aug/21 18:12,08/Sep/21 13:47,16/Sep/21 13:42,31/Aug/21 08:43,,7tops_sprint125,,,,,,"dear support,

JAREX (J. Aron / Goldman Sachs) app started since 7 August to experience a problematic behavior when executing its starting sequence, getting trapped sometimes into an infinite loop.

Credentials: User: 'CXLYJS07', appID: 'JARCOMP_0' (read only Market Data retrieval) 

“We noticed something strange was happening with our application between 20210807-23:04:50 and 20210809-10:27:25 BST.
The repeating scenario we saw looked like this: 
- login request - response, 
- product info request - response, 
- contract info request 
- failure to send the message, 
- Logout req fails as well, 
- disconnect, configured wait for 1+ minutes before next login attempt, 
- repeat. 

So the issue is that at each iteration the application was failing to send the contract info request. (“publish” api call returning an error (return value 0)).
Eventually the issue went away once we restarted the application 4 hours later.

Occurrences : 
1) between 20210807-23:04:50 and 20210809-10:27:25 BST.
2)  Saturday 14 August UTC 0210814-23:05:02.157385
3) 20210817-14:51:41.599189 UTC : for that one stopping/restarting the app did not help. It's only the maintenance window in the evening (6.11 deployment) that enabled to get rid of it.

Here is an example of a request that happened to fail 
•	send failed: envelope: typeName: '' contentType: 'x-m7/request; version=6.0' contentEncoding: '' replyTo: 'm7.private.responseQueue.CXLYJS07.1629211895564848852' appID: 'JARCOMP_0' userID: 'CXLYJS07' correlationID: '1' msg: '<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?><ContractInfoReq xmlns=""http://www.deutsche-boerse.com/m7/v6"" startDate=""2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z"" endDate=""2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z"" ><StandardHeader marketId=""EPEX""/><prodName>GB_Half_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>Continuous_Power_Peak</prodName> <prodName>XBID_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>GB_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>Continuous_Power_Base</prodName> <prodName>XBID_Half_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>GB_Peakload</prodName> <prodName>GB_Baseload</prodName> <prodName>GB_3_Plus_4</prodName> <prodName>GB_Overnight</prodName> <prodName>GB_2_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>Intraday_Half_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>GB_Extended_Peak</prodName> <prodName>Intraday_Hour_Power</prodName> <prodName>GB_4_Hour_Power</prodName> </ContractInfoReq>'

Could you please check in your logs whether why these Contract Info requests could not be published? (system busy, ...).

Note: the issue did not re-occur with 6.11 but the deployment was done only less than 24h ago.

Many thanks, 
JM

This issue required a deep investigation. As far as I understand, it happened every couple of days, but didn't happen anymore since 6.11 release. Can you please confirm it with a client?

If it's really so, we don't see much sense to put a big effort into the issue which is already resolved by 6.11 release. Please let us know if it re-occurs again with 6.11, and please provide exact time stamp when it happened, your example from point 1 is not really easy to investigate as the time window is very wide (between 20210807-23:04:50 and 20210809-10:27:25 BST.)

GS explains this did not occur since 6.11 deployment but is still very worried that this happens again / does not see (considering the M7 6.11 release note) why this new version would solve this.
Could you observe anything based on the provided data (at least from occurrence 2 where a timestamp was provided)? or nothing at all?

many thanks, JM","30/Aug/21 16:29;wn626;Hello [~jm.pournin@epexspot.com],

 

With the number of Major issues which we currently have, it's unlikely that our developers can find a time to investigate the issue since it's not re-occurring after 6.11

!TC540.PNG!","12/Aug/21 10:35;dp007;Hi Michael,

Actually it is not Report Engine you are referring to and what you see, it is Web-gui (or enquiry module as some say). In general, you don't have a direct access to Reporting Engine (RE), you use web-gui which in turn connects to Reporting Engine and retrieves all available reports for given user. As both components (web-gui and RE) are double sided (meaning they have two instances running on two different server nodes; in fact the same approach is used for core and all other parts of the system) there needs to be a synchronization mechanism distributing the reports to the second node. This is achieved by a synchronization script which is triggered every 5 minutes. This is in a nutshell a very basic description of the reporting architecture...

There is a bug in the current version of Reporting Engine (6.4.78) which actually saves the report while it is still being generated, it basically saves the incomplete report into the folder where the web-gui component reads the reports from. That's the most recent problem of report engine and that's why we are anticipating the update within the big 6.11 upgrade next week.

Regarding your question: I'm not sure if I understand it, your (home made/3rd party) component can see the report at some point of time but it appears in web-gui around 30 minutes later? If that's so, I suggest to refresh the browser or re-login.

Here are the times when RE generated the reports, so after adding 10 minutes (5 for the sync script trigger and another 5 minutes for the report transfer itself) you should get the times when the reports should have been available:

We expect to see only 2 failovers if we are going in a ""seamless"" way. Or we can stop the production, replace certs, and start env again. In this case, we will ask 30 mins of downtime. Please let us know what is better for you.

Also, as I understood previously the previous certs are fine until we reconnect the LTS, so that we possibly will do with the next maintenance in about 2 weeks. That would be no problem, correct?","02/Aug/21 09:45;wn626;Hello [~b.horvath@epexspot.com],

 

Yes, let's plan to do it tomorrow (3rd of August) at 10:00. Please confirm that it's fine with you. We will do it seamlessly node by node, so only couple of failovers are possible.

 

I wouldn't recommend waiting for 2 weeks for it. Technically it will work, but it's a bit risky because, in case of any quick disconnection from SOB, it will not be possible to connect back

 # We regenerated the report, epex confirm its validity and consistency.
 # DBG informed EPEX about the current status: 

We found the root cause of the issue, it requires a fix of the Reporting Engine tool, but till we deliver the hot fix it can reoccur (depending on a rare time coincidence), therefore please be cautious, check the file size and also the file content, namely, if it contains the ending tags at the end _</tc540>_.

Sharad","02/Jul/21 09:58;m.rendina@epexspot.com;Hi Sharad,

Thanks for the quick answer, SERVICE-9877 has indeed all the information about this. Given the possible delay of M7 6.11 and just as a personal curiosity, do you know if the fix for this can be delivered alone without waiting for the new version?
Anyway, I just wanted to raise these two tickets to also keep track of the issue; if you agree we can close this as duplicate.

Kind regards,
Matteo","02/Jul/21 14:44;yq577;Hi [~m.rendina@epexspot.com],

If i read your message correctly then you are expecting us to deliver a fix which is initially planned to deliver with 6.11 and you are expecting the fix to be delivered in 6.10 version.
If this is what you are looking then this may not be easy without some proper testing , if the fix is compatible with 6.10 and its time consuming.

I will suggest to wait for few more week until we have 6.11 ready for PROD deployment. I understand the current pain point but it much safer and secured to implement a fix x with 6.11 deployment.

Thanks and Regards,
Sharad","05/Jul/21 10:16;m.rendina@epexspot.com;Hi Sharad,

Thanks for the understanding. I was just curious about the possibilities of this fix, given also the delay we are facing with M7 6.11. But I agree with you that it would probably be much safer to wait for the new M7 version to have this fix delivered.

Thanks again and kind regards,
Matteo ","15/Sep/21 10:33;yq577;Hi [~m.rendina@epexspot.com],

Can you please check and confirm if this issue still exists after 6.11 deployment , if not can we close the ticket.

I'm raising this ticket to ask for a RCA for SERVICE-10677. I actually had raised a RCA ticket yesterday, but for some reason I can't see it anymore.

The incident was that, following an XBID configuration change in SOB, performed by XBID parties from 15:00 to around 15:12, the local products (Intraday_Hour_Power, Intraday_Half_Hour_Power and Intraday_Quarter_Hour_Power) were not visible anymore by market participants. The XBID change in the SOB involved instead XBID_Hour_Power, XBID_Half_Hour_Power and XBID_Quarter_Hour_Power products; please find the XBID change script attached, especially steps 6a to 9c.

We noticed some minutes after, in the M7 WebGui, Product Management tab, that the mentioned local products were in IACT and HIBE status (the half hourly was in HIBE, the other two in IACT). We tried several times to reactivate these products manually, but they seemed to become HIBE again everytime, until we finally succeeded around 15:43 and they remained in ACTI state after we hit the activate button.

In this case we had no issues with the previous TC540 file, that one was successfully integrated on our side. We did however have a disconnection from SOB at 4 am. So we think some order revisions may be missing anyhow. But we will also investigate on our side.

The errors we get are:

I did some more analyses on ticket and i found this ticket where the similar issue reported in SERVICE-9877.
Understand from the comment the issue is fixed in Reporting Engine is 6.5.23,  it was caused by invalid order lifecycle in TC540 in case of SOB disconnections during order creation.

Please note the Reporting Engine 6.5.23 is part of the M7 6.11 package.

Thanks and Regards,
Sharad
","22/Jun/21 13:04;royhetharia;Hi Sharad,

Indeed we have ways to fix the issue internally and we are anxiously awaiting the deployment of M7 6.11
However we felt it was good to make you aware of any consequences we experienced from the SOB disconnection.

For now it's fine to close this issue.

Actually this not exactly the right way how to interpret the numbers. Yes, that user sent us this vast number of requests but as these are requests (client -> back-end) the back-end has to respond to all requests which are sent to it. In this case it responds with:

_Reached request limit for ContractInfoReq, sent error response: Limit is 14 per 60000 ms._

and indeed in the backend logs I see these responses till 02:28:43.577.

Please note we cannot force clients to stop sending messages, we can only stop replying (when they breach the limit). Exactly in the way we did.

According  to the DFS180 description (see attached screenshot). This field is supposed to contain the price determined during the auction phase of the contract.

We would expect that this attribute will be filled in with the price of the last intraday cross-border auction price but is hard to test since we hardly ever have auction events in ASIM (inactivity of TSOs).

Can you please elaborate on when this attribute is used/filled in and confirm whether the last intraday cross-border auction price will be filled in or not?

Kind regards,
Theo","07/Jul/21 10:43;tj898;Hello, [~t.zafeiris@epexspot.com].

 

I've shortly discussed the topic with the product team.

The indicative price is indeed based on previous values of trades performed for the same contract. However, I'm not sure of how many of those trades are needed to establish the indicative value.

This feature was intended to be Deprecated, but still got in the middle of the process, so yes, it's still present, but at the moment we can't dedicate much time to it.,

We can leave the ticket as is, and if you guys think it's important, please follow the normal process to prioritize it (as mentioned previosuly).

We don't know the reason for so many messages from the client. I want to mention that maintenance finished at around 21:50 and we found these number of messages in around an hour after it.

Huge number of messages from some clients could potentially impact the whole environment, that's why our system automatically killed messages when they breached 50000 limit.

From our side, we recommend checking with the client and to avoid such situation in the future.

We performed a test yesterday with one of our members (data vendor) for which we asked them to login with their API and to let it run for 24h.

Here the details of the member in question and their login times:

Member ID: BSTDV
User ID: CXBTDV01
Application_ID: YAOUNDE_0
Login Time: 19.04.2021 14:46:59 CEST

The member confirmed to us of the time for which they logged in, we can also see that in the ASIM WebGUI (See image attached).
However in the reports file itself there is no information about any activity for member BSTDV (CXBTDV01), not even a LoginReq message.

Could you please investigate why some of the data might be missing in the reports or the reason for which we do not see any activity for this member?
Does this mean that there might be more missing data in the Daily Activity user reports for ASIM for other members/users?

Thank you in advance.

Best Regards,
 Juan

I'm really glad you found this problem, thanks to you we've discovered we had deployed the old version of the reporting tool to the new virtual machine which generates the reports, 12.4.2021 14:49:12 to be precise.

I sent you the report again for 2021-04-20, do you want me to regenerate all the ASIM reports since 12.4.?

Thank again and I'm sorry for inconvenience,

 ","19/Apr/21 15:29;dp007;Hi Juan,

I forwarded all those reports to your email addresses.

I've tested the script now and it sent the report to our m7-si email and also to an outside address and it worked well in both cases.

Please send the following header to your tech-ops. It comes from the ASIM report email I just received and which we send to you every morning. Please note the ASIM+SIMU reports are being sent from another email server then we use for PROD report.

I did some observations on our side and found that the emails do bounce back from your mail server because of an SPF failure:
{code:java}
DCID 5307744) Message 12904153 to jf.fernandez@epexspot.com bounced by destination server. Reason: 5.3.0 - Other mail system problem ('550', ['5.7.23 ETP203 SPF Failure for domain (mfrom: <deutsche-boerse.com>) - DCFC07986E78018064d8ad78b']) {code}
Which means the new mail server we use basically cannot use the official domain @deutsche-boerse.com therefore we will send the reports (since tomorrow) from the email address [logparser@m7-test.deutsche-boerse.com|mailto:logparser@m7-test.deutsche-boerse.com] (instead of logparser@deutsche-boerse.com). Once we migrate the production reports, we will use [logparser@m7.deutsche-boerse.com|mailto:logparser@m7.deutsche-boerse.com] sender address for the prod reports.

Please let me know tomorrow if you'll receive the email.

Best,
 Martin","27/Apr/21 22:18;jf.fernandez@epexspot.com;Hi Martin,

thank you for your feedback. 

Yes I can confirm that as today I did not receive any email regarding the reports. Would that also be one of the reasons of why we are not receiving some of the emails to powerspot@epexspot.com?

I will let you know tomorrow of the outcome.

Martin","04/May/21 16:27;jf.fernandez@epexspot.com;Hi Martin,

excuse me for the late reply but we have been a bit busy with other issues as you may know.
In the meantime I can confirm that I received the report from 2021-04-28 from the below mentioned address, surprisingly we are still having problems receiving only the API (not CT) reports in the powerspot@epexspot.com mailbox. I have already informed our IT and hopefully they will find a solution in the next days.

Can you confirm that the reports will now be sent daily at different timestamps i.e. in the morning and in the evening?

BR,
Juan","05/May/21 09:44;dp007;Hi Juan, I can image, lot things going on our side as well.

Honestly, I don't understand why you shouldn't have received the CT reports, both emails are being processed with the same script, using the same sender address, the attachment size is even smaller than at API, we receive both emails in our m7-si mailbox.

Please note that we are still migrating the system to the host and you may receive the reports irregularly, some times I have to trigger the report manually, at various times. I'm sorry.

I keep you posted.

BR,
Martin

 ","31/May/21 16:10;t.zafeiris@epexspot.com;Dear Martin,

Our IT colleagues investigated the issue and their assessment is:

""There seems to be an issue with DBAGs SPF record, apparently there is missing information. It seems like DBAG put in place a new mail server that's using an IP that is not authorized to send as @deutsche-boerse.com""

Can you please take this comment and see if you can solve the issue? Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Theo","01/Jun/21 08:43;dp007;Good morning Theo,

Actually that is fully in line with the investigation on our side and it is the reason why we changed the email address we send the reports from to the new address [logparser@m7-test.deutsche-boerse.com|mailto:logparser@m7-test.deutsche-boerse.com]

I checked the logs for CXNKDV02 for yesterday, and from our side, we can see just a couple of connection/disconnection. We don't see any other users affected during that period of time, that's why we believe it was network issues on the client side.

Regarding the error message, as you may see in DFS200 documentation, error 14002 means - too_many_requests_excpetion - The error is returned when the request limit via API is reached. More information can be found also in DFS180, chapter 6.1 General Requests and Responses.

In general, user sent more than 70 inquiry request during 1 hour, and that's why it was blocked to sent new inquiry requests. In this case, user needs to wait 1 hour without any inquiry requests (including no connection attempts), and try again.

This limitation is configured to block each individual user from sending too many inquiry requests and not to overload the system

Yaroslav

By principle, this is a very complicated request, since the 2 environments have different versions on it. So, most likely there will be differences in the DB schema. It's not a matter of simple migrating data from one environment to the other.

And even if the environments had the same versions, it wouldn't be a simple and quick task, and most likely would have to be discussed on the scope of Extended Package.

Sorry for not being able to help this time.

(DBAG Energy Operations)","07/Apr/21 10:16;r.essomba@epexspot.com;Good morning Hugo,

Thanks for your feedback , we understand the complexity of  it.
we would like to know  in a case of extended package , how will it be if

1) You copy all the data   from  ASIM to SIMU 
2) You copy one part from ASIM to SIMU ( only Customers: Members, BG, users, Trading Limits) and we do the rest (Market : products, shcedules, etc.)

And we can also see  something similar had already been done with semopx data  in the past in SERVICE-1639 , will it be the same process ? 

regards,

Ronald ","07/Apr/21 10:30;tj898;Hello, [~r.essomba@epexspot.com] .

The copy itself wouldn't be a problem. The issue is on the differences of DB schema that exist between versions.

So, apart from copying the data, we would also have to verify the differences between db tables in order to make it consistent, otherwise when the destination environment would start, most likely would crash. And of course, we would have to fill all the gaps, and correct ad-hoc these.

For the previous case, probably it was the same version on the source and target environments, or there was no difference on the db schemas between them.

Best regards,

Hugo","07/Apr/21 10:50;r.essomba@epexspot.com;Hello Hugo, 

many thanks , it is definitely more clear, 

we wanted to make sure of the feasibility  and do realize the complexity indeed.

As you said it  would have to be discussed on the scope of Extended Package. so we would like to know of course the terms/details of that possible extended package ( cost)  in these 2 cases 

1) You do all the process you described for all the data from ASIM to SIMU
2) You do all the process you described for only one part of referential data  from ASIM to SIMU ( only Customers: Members, BG, users, Trading Limits) and we will manually  do the rest (Market : products, shcedules, etc.)

for us to find the easiest and smoothest way for both of us

 ","20/May/21 10:26;r.essomba@epexspot.com;Hello Hugo, Denise,

First of all thank you Denise for your feedback, much appreciated.  we are still checking our options  regarding it, 

We would like to know what is the feasibility in term of environment reset , i will explain myself : 
  
1st case ) 

As we have 3 levels of Referential data ( User, Market, Product) , is it possible to request the reset of one level only? for example the Users part ( so to delete all users, members and Balancing groups)  for one environment. If so, what will be the cost in term of time ? is it something which still needs package extension?

2nd case)

what will be the cost in term of time and money if we want to reset an entire environment ( so on all level) ?

Many thanks in advance,

Ronald  ","20/May/21 15:59;tj898;Hello, [~r.essomba@epexspot.com].

The estimation that was proposed is based on the entire environment. For us, it doesn't make much difference for the initial part (the DB copy itself).

Just keep in mind that the estimations does not include the effort in case something will need to be corrected after the DB copy. Like explained in the early posts, since the versions are different, the DB schemas won't match in order to make a workable copy. Then it will only depend on the amount of inconsistencies that we will face. Those will be ad-hoc corrections that will have to performed after analysis.

Therefore, your 1st case is even worse for us, because we would need to even consider more variables. So, won't be feasible.

Hope I've been clear. If not, please revert to us any additional doubt.

Regards,

Hugo Correia","09/Jun/21 15:30;r.essomba@epexspot.com;Hello  Hugo ,

As you may see, according to the Database, this order was deleted by ComTrader, and we even know the ComTrader version (6.10.81).

 

I'm not sure how it could happen if the client is 100% sure that it was done via API. Unfortunately, I don't see the way how we can investigate it further in PROD. Is it possible to reproduce it somehow on non-prod environment?

Apologies for not replying sooner, but the issue was investigated internally and we no longer need help from your side.
The issue remains though, that the Application ID will always have the value it had when the order was first entered.
For now I close the ticket, because no further investigation is needed.

•	The attribute ‘remoteLastUpdateTm’ need to be made available in the Order Execution Report for Remote orders
•	The value for used for the attribute ‘tranTim’ in the TC540, need to be used for Remote orders the correct values (based on the ‘revisionNoTime’ of the SOB order execution report)

So far we have on the table (unconfirmed) following 2 actions needed after the XBID 3.1 is delivered:

1) parameter change
 * with XBID 3.1 package GL, XBID will be providing precise timestamp that shall be then
 ** used in tranTim field in the TC540 (there's a parameter that needs to be Activated for this, X-MEN should know the parameter name and its config details)
 ** provided in the remoteLastUpdateTm field in the OrdrExeRprt

2) redeploy M7 ELTS PROD 

This action will most likely be required, expected downtime 15-45 minutes.

Can be done at the final part of the XBID go live deployment","18/Mar/21 09:38;rehapav;[~t.juhasz@epexspot.com] just personal note for consideration, at the moment all ELTS test environments are connected to environment where XBID 3.1 is deployed already.

It would make sense to request on XBID side this sort of installation test where also downstream systems can validate actions required (if any) to be implemented during XBID installation.","24/Mar/21 14:24;t.juhasz@epexspot.com;Hi Pavel, 

Thank you for the suggestion. Could you please specify what do you mean by downstream systems? 

BR, 
Tilla","24/Mar/21 15:10;rehapav;Oh sorry [~t.juhasz@epexspot.com],

 by downstream systems in XBID world i mean every connected LTS (M7 ELTS PROD ... ).

XBID is the master of data (upstream).

LTS is a downstream system dependent on the date.

 

BR

 P.","29/Mar/21 11:11;rehapav;Analysis completed.

The defined set of actons for ELTS PROD are as follows
 * disconnect ELTS PROD from XBID PROD before XBID 3.1 delivery starts
 * during XBID 3.1 MW implement new tranTim = Activated (only RE redeployment required, no downtime for ELTS PROD)
 * connect ELTS PROD back to XBID once XBID 3.1 delivery is completed

Matteo","09/Mar/21 16:09;wn626;So, as per current stage of investigation, we can see that issue is related to 1 user only, we don't see any impact on other users.

From our side, we can see a repeatable error in our log for this user today:
{code:java}
<0.28820.3902> Channel error on connection <0.30100.3895> (10.136.151.250:42052 -> 10.139.53.168:50060, vhost: 'app', user: 'CXROSL02'), channel 2:

It could be originally declared on another connection or the exclusive property value does not match that of the original declaration.
{code}
But we cannot comment on what does it mean without ComTraders logs.

 

Also, we can see that user is using ComTrader version 6.10.72, please instruct client to use latest version 6.10.81, it could be the reason for the issue.

SWMEX has been having connection losses in the past weeks that they have not been able to assess. This past weekend they did a test with the connection with ComTrader and they experienced: 1x logout 1x connection loss, for which they said ""the tcpdump was very discreet"".

From our side, we can see user CXTWXP96 activity in the logs yesterday (9th Feb) at around 13:10-14:20, and also around 22:10. Maybe it's not an issue any more?

 

Anyway, we need to understand what exactly is wrong during with client connection to M7 via API. If user CXTWXP96 is not able to connect via API, I would do the following steps to try to get more details:
 # try to login with CXTWXP96 from your side (EPEX) via ComTrader, it will give us information if the account is working correctly or not
 # ask the client to try to connect via ComTrader, it will give us information if there are some networking issues on their side or it's API issue

Yaroslav

 ","11/Feb/21 10:43;jf.fernandez@epexspot.com;Hello Iaroslav, 

thanks for your reply.
I believe the connection you saw in the activity logs for 09/02/2021 at around 13:10-14:20 was us trying to double check if we could connect with their credentials to see if their account had issues. We were able to connect so it seems the account was working correctly after all.

As of now we have reset their password and it seems to be working fine for them, although they will keep us updated if the problem still persists. Maybe it was a revoking of the user done by themselves.

In any case, they said they will monitor their API and see if they have any other troubles. So for the time being we can close this ticket and should any further problems arise concerning this, I will open it again.

Best,
Juan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We already added a comment for the other similar issue. However, i also put the information here.

For the queue delete request, we need to align internally. However, we will have a few constrains:
 * it will be a task to be invoiced as Extended Package activity
 * it will be only performed during a market halt, since we have to avoid data changes during production periods, to keep consistency and avoid risk

We will need the approval from your side in order to proceed with the activity. +Estimation is 0.5-1 MD.+

The line _RAM: null_ is quite normal, from time to time it prints it out when it cannot retrieve the value.

Regarding the overall system performance and RAM as such: it seems to me that despite the fact their PC has 32GB of RAM this memory is used by some other component and there's not enough memory left for ComTrader.

Could please ask them to check if they have enough RAM memory available?

Best,

As the member mentioned below:
1. Before launching ComTrader from the 32GB of RAM memory, 13GB was available at all times.
2. Whenever the member launches ComTrader, the attached log is provided.
3. After pressing ok ComTrader works but really slow despite 13GB of RAM memory being free.

The member also noted out that:

Best,

This is definitely not a problem of ComTrader but the way their Java allocates memory. 

I would recommend to go to the Java Control Panel to check the Java JRE runtime parameters.

Or the restart of the PC could also help.

the member is still having the same issue after having tried to connect to ComTrader again today. According to them they tried modiying the settings in Java to increase the memory allocated yet they still got the same message ""less than 1GB memory"".
The memory RAM they have free while trying to open ComTrader is about 7-8GB according to them.

I have attached you the logfiles of today, as well as the screenshots that the member sent of their CPU usage and the Java settings they currently have.

Here the message from the member:

""Hello again,

I have been on the client pc (Mr Davey) today trying to modify the settings in Java to increase the memory allocated but still the same memory message came up “less then 1GB memory” , I also check the memory on the Pc while we trying to open Comtrader app and we have a lot more memory free about 7/8 Gb.

So still the same issue I am afraid,

I have attached some screen shots and the logs, I hope this help to figure out what happens with the Comtrader application.

Please advise we need the app to use more memory than only 512 MB on this PC, please.

It's definitely the issue on their side but here's one more idea: they could use the webstart version which utilizes 4GB.

Could you please ask them to try it out and send us back the log files?

BR,
Martin","18/Jan/21 13:29;jf.fernandez@epexspot.com;Hi Martin,

The member came back to us, apparently this is an issue happening not only one of their PCs but in other as well. 
They say that even if there are 3GB of RAM memory left in the PC, ComTrader keeps sending an alert that there is less than 1GB available. They are also wondering how the application detects the memory left in the PC and hint that perhaps ComTrader can't find the information in some PCs.

Unfortunately they are not able to use the Webstart version since their antivirus doesn't allow them to run it.

I have attached you the logfiles of the PC with which the member tried to login today 18/01/2021 and a screenshot of the CPU usage.

Here the message from the member:
""Hi 

I am afraid is not just in on pc, I have reproduce the same error in other pc now, please have a look the attached screen shot and logs files.

Even though there are 3 GB of memory on this pc the Comtrader app keep saying there are less than 1GB, How the application detect the memory left in the PC? May be there is the problem in some pc the app can’t find it this information or is wrong. Is a new version of Comtrader releasing any time soon? Thanks

Also the Web version we can’t use as our antivirus don’t allow this type of file to download, so that option is not possible in any machine at the moment.

Let me forward the last email from Friday again so you don’t missed any data of both PC that doesn’t work.

The member came back to us. It seems the issue on their end still persists and according to them it is an issue after having upgraded from 6.9.57 to 6.10.72.

The issue they have is as following:
1. Prior to the upgrade from 6.9.57, ComTrader was up and running normally in their PC (see attached logs from 01/12/2020). 
In the logs for 01/12/2020  there is no message ""INFO  c.d.c.c.j.s.JFXUserAlertService - Displaying message Startup configuration check: Unsupported configuration detected (see MFG140): - less then 1GB memory"".

2. They tried running ComTrader 6.10.72 again, after switching off the PC, doing a reboot, with only ComTrader running in the background and having free RAM memory of ~25.3GB. Since then they are getting the message ""INFO  c.d.c.c.j.s.JFXUserAlertService - Displaying message Startup configuration check: Unsupported configuration detected (see MFG140):
- less then 1GB memory"" (See attached logs of 19/01/2021).

I understand this normally is an issue on their end. However, could it be ComTrader is not being correctly allocated enough available RAM memory?
If so is there any way we could help out the member?

Here their message:

""Hello Juan

Coming back to the original PC I have been with the user and restart the PC today we also switch off everything and only run Comtrader, please see attached the result of this operation and the logs to see if this brings any ideas to your team

Any advice on this, please?

Please find also attached a log from the previous version of Comtrader in 1st Dec 2020 where this pc Comtrader worked fine last time (log date 2020)

Hi Juan, I checked again their java console settings but I don't see the letter defining the megabytes (m), only the numbers.

I guess it should be -Xms2048{color:#00875a}+m+{color} -Xmx4096{color:#00875a}m{color}

BR,
 Martin","20/Jan/21 12:17;jf.fernandez@epexspot.com;Hi Martin,

I advised the member to implement the changes and they did so but unfortunately this did not work.
Their Java settings seem to be ok:
- JRE version is 1.8.0_271
- Runtime parameters are set to -Xms 2048m -Xmx4096m
- They are using the 64-bit version

Any other clues why this continues to reoccur? 

BR,
Juan

Unfortunately Reporting Engine is really slow in generating ADMIN TC540 report. We had to kill the report processing as it was slowing down persister (=writing changes into database) and basically heavily affecting the performance of the system.

no idea how to find the session ID, sorry","23/Nov/20 13:46;wn626;Hello,

 

Session IDs can be checked in RabbitMQ Admin console only. We would like to avoid connecting to it during working hours when the number of order/trades are high. It could potentially impact all environment. But what we can see from the logs:

one single connection - yesterday it was this PID:
{code:java}
CXOMMC11   <elts-prod-amq3@m7eltsprodamq3.1.8565.5216> {code}
today it's this one connection:
{code:java}
CXOMMC11   <elts-prod-amq1@m7eltsprodamq1.1.9114.5475> {code}
 

Queues look like this:

TESLA kindly asks DBAG to delete all the queues prefixed m7.private.responseQueue.CXTSLE05 and auto_delete=false 

No greenlight is required: please proceed today whenever you can.

These are old queues which are not in use anymore, created most likely during an
outage and/or account suspension while the application was attempting to
re-connect. The behavior that led to their creation has been changed.

Can you please provide an RCA on the overrun of the planned maintenance of 29th Oct.

Agreement was that disk space cleanup would be halted at 21:30 regardless of status, but EPEX received notification that longer was needed.

","02/Nov/20 14:17;wn626;Hello [~L.Noble@epexspot.com],

 

Please see my answers in line:
 - Could we have had done the database cleanup earlier (during ECC maintenance/market halt in Sep)
 - {color:#57d9a3}Yes, technically it was possible to run cleanup script in any maintenance window. but our original planning was to do cleanup together with 6.10 release. And also it was planned to start continuously clearing tool (harvester) together with 6.10. The reason was to make only 1 cleanup session, and not do it each month or every few months{color}
 - Can DBAG give EPEX in the future an alert in advance, disc space is at 40%, 50%, 60%, clean up should be done in 8, 6, 4 weeks etc
 - {color:#57d9a3}Yes, because of this issue, we are planning now 2 possible improvements:{color}
 - {color:#57d9a3} 1. change alerting to inform us about space issue beforehand. maybe it will be 60% or 65%. DBAG is discussing it internally now{color}
 - {color:#57d9a3}2. possibly increase disk space in Database, but again it's under discussion now{color}
 - What is the reason that the disc space grew faster than expected
 - {color:#57d9a3}We can see there are 2 main root cause sources here:{color}
 - {color:#57d9a3}1. number of OMTs per day/month is higher than expected and higher than agreed in SLA. And it leads to bigger space usage{color}
 - {color:#57d9a3}2. delaying 6.10 release for later than 11/10 was not expected and need more space for more number of days{color}
 - How can you better estimate the time needed for disc space cleaned, improvement of preparation/testing
 - {color:#57d9a3}In previous points, I think I already answered this question, and also I want to highlight that we are planning to start continuously clearing tool (harvester) which should close this issue completely{color}
 - Can DBAG include a safety margin in the maintenance window estimation
 - {color:#57d9a3}We will try to improve it from our side. Please note that sometimes we will have to request longer maintenance time window{color}

 

Do you want to discuss anything else here? Or we can close the ticket now?

The problem we had with that user in the morning of 16/10 is that they were trying to log in while the user was already logged in and, despite they had the force parameter set to ""true"", they couldn't log in.

They contacted us and our workaround was to suspend the user and reactivate it. When we tried to do so though, we could still see the user was not disconnected after the suspension. We had this situation in which the user was suspended but still logged in (at least this is what we saw from the webgui).

In any case I checked with them and now the user is correctly logged in. Were there similar issues in the past that you know of? Apart from that I'd say we can close this.

I keep you informed.

Martin","29/Sep/20 14:55;dp007;Hi Thijs,

l'm thinking about sending you only that one particular day in the report, so we will not include data for two days in each report.

Let's say till now the report for 2020-09-28 (sent today/2020-09-29) which contained two days:
 * 2020-09-27
 * 2020-09-28

From now on I suggest we will send you *two emails*/reports *ONLY FOR PROD* every day, let's say this morning (2020-09-29) we would send these:

 * a report for 2020-09-27 containing only data related to that day
 * a report for 2020-09-28 containing only data related to that day

By this approach we will send you the same amount of data as of now (2 days backs) it's just going to be split into two separate emails/files.

Please let me know what do you think about this proposal.

BR,
Martin","02/Oct/20 15:13;T.Engels@epexspot.com;Martin,

Apologies for the delay. With regards to your proposal I think that is definitely the way forward. Not sure who within EPEX should formally approve this, but I'll liaise internally before providing the formal OK.

Thijs","05/Oct/20 08:58;dp007;Hi Thijs,

Or even we can send you all three emails till you come to a conclusion.

We will be sending you the following on daily basis:
 * User activities related to API on M7 Production (2 days back data)
 * User activities related to API on M7 Production (1 day data for day -1)
 * User activities related to API on M7 Production (1 day data for day -2)


 * User activities related to CT on M7 Production (2 days back data)
 * User activities related to CT on M7 Production (1 day data for day -1)
 * User activities related to CT on M7 Production (1 day data for day -2)

By this you can evaluate it with real data and compare the results side by side.

BR,
Martin","08/Oct/20 13:58;dp007;Hi Thijs, I applied the proposed changes and since tomorrow morning you and I we will start receiving the 1 day data packages (for d-1 and d-2).

Later on when you align internally we can send it to powerspot as well.

I had a look at the information which is currently received. Find below my feedback.

For the past days we have received 5 email messages with attachments.

As example I used the full names and times for today, but this is re-presentable for the past days.

CT_report-2020-10-19.zip [2020-10-17 00:00 .. 2020-10-19 01:00]

Am I correct that:
- The emails @ 07h40 and 07h41 should have 2020-10-18 in the subject and filenames (opposed to the current 2020-10-19)?
- The email @ 07h53 is a leftover of the 'old' setup (would explain the missing API version)?

If you can confirm the first point, and update this accordingly, then the proposal (and implementation) as you have done solve the problems we have earlier. As a follow up I assume the job sending out the email @ 07h53 (and most likely the API one) can be replaced this setup.

Thank you very much for your efforts on this!","19/Oct/20 11:31;dp007;Hi Thijs, thank you for noticing.

Basically the old way of the reports which processes two days does contain a day when it is being processed (2020-10-19).

On the other hand the version for dedicated day has in subject the day it is for (2020-10-17).

But this special version I made for you uses one day from the old two-day version (therefore 2020-10-19) and the second day from the dedicated day version (2020-10-17) so it is an unfortunate hybrid of both worlds.

Therefore I'm going to change the generation process to use dedicated day version for both emails and you will receive 
 * 2020-10-18 - containing data for 2020-10-18
 * 2020-10-17 - containing data for 2020-10-17

Basically it is like a reporting engine reports (ADMIN TC540 etc) where the name of the report reflects the data/days it covers.

I will send you the new version shortly.

Looks good to me. Will provide positive recommendation to Scott and get back to you with the formal OK.

(side topic; although mentioned before, is there is reason that for the API files only ~30% of entries include the mandatory application id?)
","19/Oct/20 12:53;dp007;I found that application ID is retrieved from the login message so most probably the session started the day before or earlier.","19/Oct/20 13:30;T.Engels@epexspot.com;Martin, thank you for the feedback. Had the idea this was different in the past, but could be wrong here.

More importantly is another question I received internally. Especially as we have had a very interesting coupled of weeks with regards to M7 activity. Would it be possible to receive the (missing API) reports for the past period (can/will look up exact dates, but would think we are talking 3-4 weeks of data in total)?","19/Oct/20 14:21;dp007;Technically yes, it is feasible, but it will require a lot of work as the logs are already rolled out from the source folders. Probably this would be marked as extended package (depending on Product Owner/ACM)","20/Oct/20 13:58;T.Engels@epexspot.com;Martin,

I can hereby indicate that we have green light to extended the recipients list with powerspot@epexspot.com.

Could you confirm that this would then replace the emails which are sent thus far?

With regards to the retrieval of history; I have passed your feedback internally and will get back to this.

Thijs","20/Oct/20 15:08;dp007;Thanks Thijs,

From tomorrow morning on we start sending these one day reports to powerspot email. This will replace the current 2days approach.

We got further info from TRAILSTONE:

- as a result they prefer having a direct status from DBAG on the availability of the Leased Line before trying to switch back to it.

1) Can we expect an answer in the afternoon / what's the internal SLA for such an issue?
2) Please check my last comment as well on SERVICE-8164 : since TRAILSTONE switched to a regular Internet connection they do not suffer anymore from their frequent ""End Of stream"" errors (they just experienced 1 single disconnection at 12:44 on Saturday, log in the other ticket). So this ""end of stream"" issue might be linked as well to an early ""weakness"" of the Leased Line before it completely stops on Saturday.

Kr,

Based on the analyses from last few days we identified the issue because of outdated version of HA proxy.

I will update you more once we upgrade the new version of HA proxy on Non production.

 ","08/Sep/20 12:01;jm.pournin@epexspot.com;Hi Sharad,
Thanks for your feedback.
1) Could you please elaborate a bit on why the HA proxy is outdated? (which functionality is missing, does the version have to match another component version, etc.).
2) Did you discuss internally how can such a version issue be avoided in the future?

Many thanks, JM","08/Sep/20 13:00;yq577;Hosts with upgraded kernel to 3.10.0-957.27.2.el7 (some security fix) are unable to properly scale tcp window, leading to stalled connections. All such hosts needs to be upgraded to RHEL 7.7 with a fixed kernel. Any host in the path with this kernel may cause terminated connections because of timeout on any side.

Originally, many tcp connections have very small tcp windows, leading to disconnects even during handshake, and various disconnects during peak simulation. After the upgrade, the tcp windows are big enough and not scaling down, avoiding a lot of unnecessary timeouts

We discussed this internally and as a solution we are upgrading OS to RH 7.7 for HAProxies in Non Production envt on this Wed 09.09.2020 and if that is successful then we implement it in production

 ","08/Sep/20 13:40;rehapav;Dear [~jm.pournin@epexspot.com],

 ad 1) HAProxies are not outdated - that have agreed RH 7.6 version.  We identified that this RH version still has some limitations:
Hosts with the upgraded kernel to 3.10.0-957.27.2.el7 (some security fix) are unable to properly scale tcp window, leading to stalled connections.
We want to upgrade only HAProxy seamlessly and other components would be upgraded to RH 7.7 as part of the Regular 6.10 release.
 
ad 2) I think this was answered implicitly by (1) . OS is for us 3rd party software and as such can/contains bugs that are being continuously fixed.
 
Cheers
 Pavel ","08/Sep/20 19:49;jm.pournin@epexspot.com;hello and thanks Pavel for the additional details.

For sure 3rd party softwares can be bugged.
My question (2) was more related to whether or not this bug discovery was an opportunity to have identified new specific/extreme testing conditions to be re-used during the next performance tests for instance.
The issues is described below from a technical angle and we do not understand if you could correlated this to a specific load/behavior of client API apps.
Cheers,
JM","09/Sep/20 13:54;rehapav;Thanks Jean-Marc for clarification,

 I understand your point of view - while we did just today the HAProxy OS upgrade I have asked the team how can we see if this actually fixed the issue?

Can we reproduce this behaviour or see this behaviour somewhere else but on ELTS PROD? For example ELTS ASIM.

Team confirmed to me that this behaviour is nowhere to be seen but on ELTS PROD.

The test we are doing now with HAProxies is more negative testing - to see if OS upgrade on HAProxy without OS upgrade on CORE does not cause any issues.

The involved customers replied everything was fine after the upgrade, but please note they mentioned as well that everything was fine before the upgrade (back to normal a few days before the upgrade, maybe just because of less intense market conditions/activity).

We asaked during the OPAC meeting last week (9.09) to have a more functional statement to communicate to our customers the nature of the fix (what kind of market load / circumstances would lead to ""saturate"" the HA proxy): Martin Matejka mentioned that DBAG would come back to us with a statement.
Could you please check with Martin and put the statement here?

Many thanks, JM","18/Sep/20 09:33;pn508;Hi [~jm.pournin@epexspot.com],

it's difficult to provide a functional assessment of the issue itself as it was purely technical and it took quite a significant effort for our team to identify the root cause on a tcp windows level under high system load. The issue itself could potentially occur even with medium load, but the high load I'm referring to was artificially used due to simulation purposes.

More importantly, we have implemented a test that monitors the connections of our test clients in Stability test environment with ELTS PROD like load. It was confirmed that the test was failing before the HA proxy upgrade and was passing afterwards.

The member claims the files were corrupt at the time of download. Is this something you can check? the member sent the attached as an example. If this was the case then i would expect the re-generation at no fee.

If it was not the case, then happy to add it under the extended package.

Well, with such a time interval, we don't have a way to regenerate the report, since the data is no longer in the Reporting Engine. So, we cannot replicate the issue and confirm (or not) that the report was sent correctly.

The only thing we can do it to fetch the data again from the DB. That will imply:
 * dump the content into another DB schema + data
 * manipulate the content
 * export the result
 * redo the report

Of course this will be very time consuming, hence the extra service will need to  be invoiced.

On August 26th 2020, a so-called DDoS attack, flooding of the Internet access, was carried out against the Internet connectivity systems at the DBAG’s Frankfurt location. The attack started at 14:00 CET and lasted for 60 minutes.

After the attack was identified, appropriate measures to ward off the attack (scrubbing) were activated immediately. At 15:30 CET, all access systems were working properly again. 

DBAG employees in relevant critical functions were promptly requested to work at their locations.

As a result M7 Trading experienced Internet connectivity issues between 14:00 CET and 15:30 CET.

We will keep you informed about the further clarification and developments of the matter, as necessary.

We just discussing whether and how we can improve the login process on our side and one idea is that once an issue is solved or maintenance work done, to inform the members to start logging in as of now. And the market itself will be started approx. 10 min later.
Currently it is the other way round, which is experienced as an unfair market situation by members that are not able to login right away after market restart.

From your technical perspective, would the change of procedure make any difference?

Can we move the discussion please to originally open ticket for ""password expiration policy""? It's SERVICE-4506. In this case, everybody will be on the same page. I'm going to close this ticket as duplicate.

But in general, from DBG point of view, ACUT testing seems to be successful. From our point of view, now we need to apply password expiration policy (60 days) on all our non-prod environments, take some time for testing, and after it, proceed with deployment to PROD. Please note that password expiration can be applied any time, not only together with 6.10.

You mean connection glitches in general? Please note the topology of the connection running via Colt/MPLS isn't straightforward. In order to eliminate the risk of the connection issues - all the parts of the connection chain have to be bulletproof.

Actually the message like *Amount of messages: 85038 (exceeded 50000)* is about something else.

It comes from RabbitMQ (our AMQP server = message broker) which is basically constantly sending messages about changes in the order book, trades, users, basically all the updates do come from this system.

All the recipients do have a kind of a storage inside that Rabbit which serves as place where it keeps the messages the client still haven't consumed (=received). You can picture that as unread messages in your mailbox.

When it says that the amount of messages exceeds the limit it actually means the client is not consuming the messages fast enough and this situation is slowing down the performance of the server. That's why we have the limit in place.

Basically even when a user just logs in and waits and doesn't send any API messages he can easily breach the limit when he is not fast enough in consuming the incoming influx.

I hope this explanation helps you in understanding how the system works.

Yes, I recreated the missing reports for the following days:
 * 2020-08-08
 * 2020-08-09
 * 2020-08-10
 * 2020-08-11

But the problem with the too big email size isn't solved yet.

I'm going to apply these measures:
 * use maximum zip compress level
 * zip also the CSVs

On our side we don't receive emails bigger than 15MBs so if the measures will not help we would have to split the zip archive into 14MB slices and send them separately.

BR,
Martin","11/Aug/20 10:13;dp007;Hi Thijs,

I recreated the API report for 2020-08-07 (should be in your mailbox). Please note it contains only that day (no overlapping as usual - already attached here in the ticket).

I have applied the measures and I will close the ticket on Thursday if all the report will be successfully created and sent.

Best,
Martin","11/Aug/20 12:56;T.Engels@epexspot.com;Although I can not find/see the file attached to this ticket, it should be fine with the files sent by email.

I have 2 points here:
 # This ticket was already closed 2 times: in beginning of August, and in beginning of September. Maybe it's better to raise a new ticket now? Otherwise it could be confused.
 # in you last comment you mentioned 2 cases which happened on 3rd of Septemer and 11th of September. It's almost month past since that time, maybe you have more recent examples?

For simplicity we would rather keep the discussion here. The first time the ticket was closed by mistake (we thought it was a duplicate) and the second was closed for inactivity, but still no explanation was given about the issue. It would be good for us to have something to give to the member (as we did for the other issue with them) in order to show that we properly follow up on their disconnections, which they seem concerned about.

Kind regards,

*Time Zone:

Justification of the work:
We will be conducting a maintenance on our network to perform a software upgrade on our Juniper Access Router SAR18.FRA located at Colt’s node in Frankfurt. The new release includes bug fixes for a flap issue in the current code, and enables Colt to move to the latest recommended release with continued vendor support. First the team will upload the 64 bit Junos around the first 10 minutes of the window, which will result in the BGP sessions to flap. The team will then upgrade the backup routing engine. Once the backup routing engine has been upgrade, traffic will be shifted to it from the primary routing engine which will result in a 5 to 10 minute outage. This activity takes around 1 hour inclusive of  monitoring the traffic. Once all stable, the team will upgrade the primary engine and once complete, again shift traffic back, resulting in a again in a 5 to 10 minutes outage.  Once again with monitoring, it will take around one hour. After this, the team will perform 2 card reloads which  will cause a 15 minutes outage each, for all change to be in effect. These actions should be completed within the first 7 hours of the maintenance window, but we do quote an 8 hour window to cover all eventualities. Back out plan: Our engineers reserve 60 minutes of the maintenance window to roll the upgrade back to the current release should any unforeseen difficulties occur during the work.",,dp007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28/Jul/20 08:45;j.bednarz@epexspot.com;Services_OCNA0120170_CRQ1-29860484254_1595609292663.csv;https://jira.deutsche-boerse.com/secure/attachment/86068/Services_OCNA0120170_CRQ1-29860484254_1595609292663.csv",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sw455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EPEX,Information Request,,,,,35856000,,,dm700,lw641,ox626,rehapav,sw455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,,,,3,,,,,None,,,M7T,,,,"2|hzy2yf:",9223372036854775807,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""issueId"":98424,""testStatuses"":[]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,46:34,1w,,,,,,,,PROD,,,,,,"28/Jul/20 08:48;j.bednarz@epexspot.com;

For this purpose, both, client and server rely on a trusted third party, the so called ""certificate authorities"". Those hold a super safe key that nobody else knows and with this key they can ""sign"" certificates. They first sign a CA certificate and share it with the whole world, with operating systems providers, with web browser providers and shared libraries etc.

The CA certificate is used only on the client side to verify the ""certificate chain"".

 

On Haproxy and Apache webservers we provide the necessary chain certificates and the server certificate, but never the CA certificate. It's now up to the client, to select the correct CA certificate.

A second cluster of issues contained client libraries, that were unable to build an alternative chain. In this case, the server had to provide explicitly the new chain. This was changed during the emergency maintenance after the CA certificate expiration in order to allow compatibility with all potential client libraries.

Thanks for these explanations.
The idea of these questions was to be sure we understand the sequence of installations/changes on DBAG side.
We do understand now that DBAG does not install the CA root certificate but only the ""derived"" ones (server + intermediate).
Could you then please just tell us when this (server + intermediate) certificate installation was done before the expiry?

DBAG communicated a change of Root CA Certificate via email on *May 14th, 2020* informing about:

EPEX should inform customers using own/custom client applications that *in case their application uses explicit truststore it has to include CA valid after May 2020 (in ideal way till 2038) with following issuers:*

 
{code:java}
CN=USERTrust RSA Certification Authority, O=The USERTRUST Network, L=Jersey City, ST=New Jersey, C=US
CN=COMODO RSA Certification Authority, O=COMODO CA Limited, L=Salford, ST=Greater Manchester, C=GB
{code}
Every API user must have the certificate from the link below installed in their truststores:

[https://crt.sh/?d=1199354]

After initial troubleshooting of the issue reported by few members, we've conculded their software was not configured properly and suggested following:

 
{code:java}
A client software with a recent ssl library should be able to perform a successful ssl handshake when provided with this truststore (or when using an updated standard Operating system truststore). This leads us to the option, that the client software uses a library which is unable to replace a server side provided chain only partly.

Currently, all API endpoints provide a compatible chain so most client software was able to seamlessly connect to it before and after 30th of may. This compatibility option can now be removed. Therefore, a redeployment of the respective SSL termination layer (haproxy) is required. We can perform this change any time now, but it will disrupt existing connections multiple times. ComTrader sessions will get disconnected as well (but should be able to login immediately again). Despite the disconnection, there is no impact on the backend or processing of orders in any kind.
{code}
 

On the top of that, we've provided consultancy support with a very short notice from EPEX side having DBAG developers and infra specialists joining a conference call to help those customers configuring their software properly.

*To sum it up:* in case affected customers would have configured their software properly, this issue wouldn't occur. This fact was also supported by majority of other API users being able to connect before and after Root CA replacement without any issues. As such, we won't be compiling an incident report since the issue was outside of our control and identified as software misconfiguration on the customer side.

Please let me know if you have more questions.

Regards, Serhii

following SERVICE-6426, EPEX would like to understand the situation a bit better.
Prior to the Root CA expiry and also in course of the trouble shooting process we have provided SIEEX with the information of the required adjustments to be made in case clients are using trust store explicitly. Which is...
""

Please inform your customers using own/custom client
applications that in case their application uses explicit truststore it has
to include CA valid after May 2020 (in ideal way till 2038) with following
issuers:

 

CN=USERTrust
RSA Certification Authority, O=The USERTRUST Network, L=Jersey City, ST=New
Jersey, C=US

CN=COMODO RSA Certification Authority, O=COMODO CA
Limited, L=Salford, ST=Greater Manchester, C=GB""

But this did not help. Furthermore, you provided a new cert an stated the following:


“The
shown contents of the file ""keystore_output.txt"" are valid and
complete enough from our perspective. A client software with a recent ssl
library should be able to perform a successful ssl handshake when provided with
this truststore (or when using an updated standard Operating system
truststore).
This leads us to the option, that the client software uses a library which is
unable to replace a server side provided chain only partly.
Currently, all API endpoints provide a compatible chain so most client software
was able to seamlessly connect to it before and after 30th of may. This
compatibility option can now be removed. Therefore, a redeployment of the
respective SSL termination layer (haproxy) is required.”

The redeployment of the SSL termination layer (haproxy) was performed on Tuesday last week.



We would like…

(1)    to
understand whether there might be any action that you/we have suggested SIEEX/ FIS
(their ISV) have not been performed –
e.g. the proposed adjustment by you. 

(2)    knowing
that MVV does use TLS v1.2, how can MVV/customers in general identify an SSL library that is
not appropriate certificate wise (that leads to not support an expired part in
the certificate chain)?



Is there any possibility from your side to make any
assessments?

Thanks a lot!

Diana

{code:java}
expiry notification more than two weeks in advance -> in order to carefully assess and gain more detailed information with your help and inform our clients accordingly{code}
Expiration of a root certificate is approx. once per 20-25 years event, I don't see it as a background for further development of this topic.
{code:java}
proactive exchange/ replacement of certs during weekdays only, due to better support on DBAG side{code}
Our goal is to replace SSL certificates seamlessly, without any impact on application or its components.

prior test opportunities in one of our test environments for members (e.g. ASIM){noformat}
This is something you can agree during UAT phases with Product Owner.

The intention of my initial request was to gain a better insight and understanding for future issues.
Yes, I agree the specific problem is solved. But this is for training purposes on our end.{noformat}
If you see it necessary to follow-up, I could propose those 2 topics to work on:
 * troubleshooting of particular customer 3-rd party software installation, SSL libraries usage, consultation on particular use cases etc.: it can be done via consultancy services provided by DBG;
 * generic training of EPEX support team members for understanding and troubleshooting SSL-related issues: might be done as a workshop provided by DBG.

Both topics would require pre-approval from our ACM.

We can discuss it once again during the upcoming OPAC call, if further clarification is needed - please add it to agenda in such case.

Thanks

Regards, Serhii","30/Jun/20 13:34;d.eichler@epexspot.com;Hi Serhii,

ad1) yes, the root CA expires in 2038, but my request is related to cert topics in general like the server cert (e.g.)

ad2) yes, the deployment itself went seamless, but the issues on member side started when the root CA itself expired.

ad3) in order to test during UAT, an information well in advance would be required in order to coordinate that. And related to any kind of cert topic.

Yes, a workshop for EPEX would be a good idea in general. I will come back to you concerning this.
In general, EPEX does not see the consultancy service as a standard process and of course cannot be provided to all clients that have issues with certs. The idea is to be well prepared before the cert change happens - on member and EPEX side.

Therefore, a notification well in advance is required from our side, in order to assess any impact, collect information, communicate to our members and support them in advance.

Kr,
Diana","14/Jul/20 17:00;lw641;Hi Diana,

We've informed EPEX about upcoming change of Root CA on May 14th, I've pasted below a quote of email that was sent out. Please let me know if such notification is not considered being sent well in advance and help me to understand your expectations here.

Server certificates are expiring within a shorter period, we inform EPEX in advance in case an additional action is required. We do that with sufficient lead time, but again I'm happy to discuss further in case you see space for improvements here.

Thanks

Of course EPEX tried to align internally first, but at the end we are also depending on the customer feedback after the customer communication, which could have been sent on 19/05/2020 the earliest.
As we wanted to provide the full information package to our clients (incl. expiry notification as well as maintenance window info).
We would have appreciated a notification a bit more in advance. What do you consider as sufficient lead time for the next sever certificate expiry?

FYI, the link to download the certificate was not shared with us beforehand. The first time it was mentioned was in course of the troubleshooting for SIEEX.
If we would have had the link before, it might have been easier.

Kr,
Diana","28/Jul/20 15:45;r.klesse@epexspot.com;Dear Serhii, 

can we please align on a process regarding informing and sharing all necessary things to us. 

Best Robert","15/Sep/20 15:15;lw641;Hi Diana, Robert,

As it was agreed on the OPAC meeting, we are not investing further time into root CA topic since it is extremely rare one (we expect next expiry to happen in 20-25 years).

Regarding certificate expiry topic, our goal is to replace upcoming certificates expiration seamlessly to the customers. In case seamless replacement is not possible and we need to notify the customer(s), we will reach out to your team first to coordinate the activity.

If EPEX would like to understand SSL certificate management process better, we can schedule a workshop for training the EPEX Market Ops team.

Regarding further process enhacements, please open a new ticket and outline your suggestions. In general, I'd start with these questions:
 * topic for improvement
 * current state, why improvement is needed?
 * what exactly are you looking to improve? a process, knowledge around it etc.
 * how could we assist you to achieve the desired state?

Please aim to include some tangible expectations (i.e. ""a bit more in advance"" doesn't really give a hint).

Hope this helps!

I will set this ticket as closed now.

Regards, Serhii

We will need some more details here. Can you please clarify what happened? What do you think was wrong? What is expected by you to be correct action here?

 

In general, I can provide you with Cross Trade Protection details from the documentation:

Cross Trade Protection If the option is checked, a warning message is displayed whenever the user is about to
submit an order that could match an existing own order. That is, the order to be matched
has been submitted for one of the balancing groups assigned to the trader who has submitted
the aggressor’s order.
Example 1:
There exist BG1 and BG2 assigned to member A.
Trader 1 has assigned BG1, Trader 2 has assigned both BG1 and BG2. When Trader 1
enters a Buy order on BG1 and Trader 2 enters a Sell order on BG2, the cross trade warning
is triggered.
Example 2:
There exist BG1 and BG2 assigned to member A.
Trader 1 has assigned BG1, Trader 2 has assigned BG2. When Trader 1 enters a Buy order
on BG1 and Trader 2 enters a Sell order on BG2, the cross trade warning is NOT triggered.
Example 3:
There exist BG1 and BG2 assigned to member A.
Trader 1 has assigned BG1 and BG2. Trader 2 has assigned only BG2. When Trader 1
enters a Buy order on B

Please note we have infrastructure change planned which is about N7 leased lines  has to be secured by a double layer firewall for leased line of M7Prod Equinix because of security requirements and therefore the second firewall has to be added to this connection.

Prior approval of this change we would like to know the status of earlier ticket SERVICE-5995 whether the EPEX connectivity is configured correctly and able to reach the secondary leased-line endpoints (Hausen1). From the last incident we assume that there may be some issues with EPEX's own configuration on these applications. We want to avoid that your connections are disrupted, so we have temporarily rejected this change request from our connectivity teams, but it is related to security requirements and will have to be executed soon. If EPEX can confirm that their applications (DTT) are configured to reach both DBAG leased line end-points there should be no impact here. 

Thank you for your feedback

But I thought the old cert is still valid.

FCEEX cannot download it from the mentioned URL in SERVICE-6128. Is there any further tool required? Furthermore, I cannot share the cert in SERVICE-6128.

Please advise, as our client do not have any access anymore.

[~d.eichler@epexspot.com], the certificate i've added to SERVICE-6128 isn't supposed to be used to connect to API. It's a server certificate.

They need to use a client certificate which name should be something like EPEX001.p12

Regards,
Hugo Correia","30/Apr/20 17:35;d.eichler@epexspot.com;Hi all,

according to FCEEX they cannot login to their API anymore since the renewal, maybe coincident. 
They sent my below logs and Yaroslav said their client cert expires. But they are using EPEX0221 and EPEX0233 which are still valid until 02/11/2021.

Therefore, I would like to understand what caused the problem. What does the error message below say?

As you said, they did not try to login today, I will check with them.

Kr,
Diana","30/Apr/20 19:59;tj898;Hello, [~d.eichler@epexspot.com].

The expire date of the certificate is indeed 02/11/2021. So, it should be fine regarding that,

Anyway, can you please confirm with the member that they are using those EPEX0221 and EPEX0233? Is it possible that they got confused with the server certificate topic and tried to use that? Even if you could not transfer it to then, they could also have tried to obtain it though the browser. I don't know, this is a strange behavior and we have to consider all possibilities.

Also, in case the issue still maintains, please provide us the plain text logs of the occasion they tried.

Thank you.

I would like to know if you've more information on the rootcause of this incident.

Indeed we're about to send tomorrow a communication to members to launch Nordic Markets on M7/XBID on 26th May. Unfortunately this kind of issue is quite sensitive from members perspective and the timing for business communication could also sound inappropriate after this kind of outage.

Consequently, could we have more details on this issue (rootcause, possible frequency, sensitivity of this issue (blocking, major, minor etc...)) by tomorrow noon.

Due to the M7 Cell Coordinator absence. an alignment call will be welcome tomorrow with David Tessier, Tamiro Rakow, Diana Eichler & me to shed the light on these items & to make the best decision in terms of communication.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you

Many thanks,

Sebastien ROLLAND
Continuous Project Manager","30/Apr/20 12:46;wn626;Hello EPEX,

We finished our investigation and can provide you with the details on what happened:
M7 user modified his remote order and it was sent to XBID, then short disconnection occurred between M7 and XBID, and reply from XBID was lost. The modified order was not deleted from M7 as expected, but hanged there (in orderbook pool) for 7 days. After 7 days Housekeeping task started to clean all inactive contracts from pools, the order was still in the orderbook pool. There is in M7 logic fixing references to keep data consistent in pools, this logic tried to find a contract to the hanging order, but was unsuccessful (contract was not there because of housekeeping) so Core failed over. The order still marked with status Active in Database was loaded to memory by slave, but contract was not active, that was the reason why core could not start. We have to change order's state to Inactive manually to be able to start core.

*Affected contract: contract_id* = 11701321 (20200421 14:00-20200421 15:00)
*Affected order: order_id* = 10740772554, external_id = 350877190
Order modify was sent to XBID on April 21st 2020, 12:26:33.186
Short disconnection with XBID: from April 21st 2020, 12:26:33.209 to April 21st 2020, 12:26:33.942

*Short term solution:* we are preparing the script, which will catch such kind of orders, if any. It will help us to identify such danger beforehand, and don't put system down

*Long term solution:* update housekeeping task to remove all orders together with expired contracts from orderbook pools

*Possible frequency:* in general such issue could happen very rarely. Housekeeping is clearing the contracts 7 days before today's date. We ran the check script (from temporary solution) today, it means that in next 7 days we are in save. And we are planning to run it everyday, so reoccurrence of the issue is totally not expected.

Hope it answers all your questions, please let us know if a call is still required.

in SERVICE-6190 you mentioned ""Issue happened because of order_id 10740772554. we will provide deep investigation and will let you know what exactly was wrong"" and when I checked our internal database that this order_id has not been submitted on 29/04, 28/04, 27/04 and even 26/04, if I compare it with the other order_ids that day.

Do you have also any explanation for that?

Hello EPEX,
Here are details of the analysis of this issue so far:
A M7 user modified an existing remote order. The update was sent to XBID, but during the time the resposne was sent back from XBID, the connection between M7 and XBID was interrupeted and the response from XBID was lost. The modified order was then not removed from M7 as it should have been, but hung there (in orderbook pool) for 7 days. After 7 days a housekeeping task started to clean all inactive contracts from the system, and encountered the order still stuck in the orderbook pool. There is logic in M7 fixing references to keep data consistent in pools, this logic tried to find a contract to the hanging order, but was unsuccessful (contract was not there because of housekeeping). This is causes an unrecoverable error on M7, causing the active core to crash and fail over to the slave core. The order still marked with status Active in Database was loaded to memory by slave, but contract was not active, that was the reason why core could not start. We have to change order's state to Inactive manually to be able to start core.
Affected contract: contract_id = 11701321 (20200421 14:00-20200421 15:00)

This is an inappropriate case and we raised a Jira ticket to prepare a fix for it. Hopefully, it will be done in the next sprint.

As a short term solution, we already implemented a check which is running everyday.

I hope this is enough details as a part of RCA, so I'm going to close this ticket.","05/May/20 14:17;wn626;Information from XBID confirmed that response from XBID was lost in M7.

Long term solution #1 (housekeeping task fix) is already implemented. It's done in version 6.8.143, and also delivered to future versions 6.9 and 6.10.

Second solution is now in progress, we are working on it. But please note that first solution will be enough to 100% fix the issue.

We would like to update the information we have regarding SERVICE-6239.

 

During our investigation, we’ve found out that the _OrdrExeRprt_ messages have not been unacknowledged on M7 Trading side, but, that they were sent by XBID in an interrupted manner. That is, the sequences of the messages don’t correspond to their timestamps.

 

In the sequence of three messages, the lowest timestamp (left column) has been sent with the highest sequence number (right column):

 

1587464793206 -> 84764725
 1587464793209 -> 84764726
 1587464793204 -> 84764727

 

Please see the original logs:

We improved our maintenance task for orderbook pool to give an extra resilience to M7 features in such case, however we consider the above mentioned problem as a flaw in XBID code. According to XBID DFS510 documentation, the order of the sequence number should be guaranteed (except for the sequence gap):

 

3.3.4 Sequence counting for Broadcast Messages
 There will be a sequence number used to identify the order of the broadcasts and to find out if some broadcasts have been lost. The sequence number is not part of the payload but it is stored within the header of the AMQP message as an attribute called x-m7-group-sequence.
 *The sequence will be always increased by one for the next broadcast.* It will be in-memory only (NOT persistent) which means that when the XBID SOB system shuts down or terminates, the sequence will be reset to 0. Whenever the PX gets a value which is not expected (i.e. value different than last_value+1) it should request the market data from the XBID SOB system.
 The sequence number is counted based on the routing keys (attribute x-m7-group-id in message header). So for each routing key there will be a different sequence number. All queues bound to the default broadcast exchange with the same routing key will receive the same sequence ID.

 

As we believe that this behavior is erroneous, we would like to ask you to open a discussion with XBID.

Martin","23/Jun/20 14:00;d.eichler@epexspot.com;Dear Martin,

We're still investigating. This one isn't simple at all.

Regards,

Hugo Correia","16/Jun/20 14:17;dp007;Root cause found, implementation phase will follow.

*Root cause:*

The linked product's contract could not be activated because an order was still active for the master product's contract, even when the master product's contract was in CLSD phase. Normally, XBID closes these orders, but in this case, information on M7 and XBID was not in sync.
This inconsistency was created when M7 failed to receive a UDEL OrdrExeRprt for that order. Partial synchronization was triggered, but it did not clean up the inconsistency. This is the scenario in detail:
 # on M7 we had order A on remote product with local schedule in status ACTI, the same order was ACTI on XBID
 # then there's a gap in OrderExeRprt sent by XBID, we miss: 1. UDEL on order A and 2. UADD on order B, for which A is parent (parentOrdrId of B = orderId of A)
 # on XBID, order A become IACT due to the UDEL
 # we trigger partial resync (OrderReq) and get only UADD of order B (the UDEL of A will not be sent, because on XBID, the status of order A is IACT and inactive orders are not sent)
 # we apply UADD and create order B in M7, order A in M7 is not updated (confirmed by code analysis and an integration test)
 # order A status in M7 is never updated and remains ACTI forever (until 28.4. where it causes M7 EPEX PROD to crash)","19/Jun/20 10:54;tj898;Good morning, [~d.eichler@epexspot.com] .

EPEX Market Operation is not in favor of performing any
exceptional maintenance work in the current situation and EPEX would prefer to postpone such changes to the time we are fully staffed back in the office. If I am not mistaken, this was also communicated by Denis Besnier to DBAG.

The TC540 (for ADMIN) are usually created much later (around 05:30). Let me give you few examples from last days:

20200411 - 05:28:04

20200410 - 06:09:50

20200409 - 04:42:05

20200408 - 05:38:45

20200407 - 05:29:31

20200406 - 05:32:42

20200405 - 05:00:58

I don't see a point of creating Major incident ticket at this time (03:47).

Nonetheless I checked the log files and the report generation is ongoing and is at 75% done.

I hope you will have your reports ready next week at this time (new version will be deployed on 14/04).

Error message ""ACCESS_REFUSED - Login was refused using authentication mechanism PLAIN"" means that login-password is incorrect. Successful connection to ComTrader also confirmes it. Please ask client to double check login-password.

Yaroslav","14/Apr/20 14:08;d.eichler@epexspot.com;Hi Yaroslav,

I had a brief call with the client for clarification:
(1) Issue with ""Access refused"" is solved.
(2) But he still receives the error message concerning the profile server. It seems to me, he cannot access it and therefore the local profile is used. Surprisingly, he only gets this error message via the CT and via his API, even though using the same users. He assumes the error message might be ""swallowed"" by the API. Do you see any reason for the non-connection to the profile server? I can see a time out, but is it only linked to an unstable network in their side or can it be something else as well?

Kr,
Diana","14/Apr/20 15:05;wn626;Hello [~d.eichler@epexspot.com],

 

Looks like it's a different issue, and not related to original error message provided.

As this issue is happening for both CT and API, let's try to investigate CT issue first, it will be easier to understand what is wrong.

As for now, I can only guess that possibly user is using old (not updated) stand-alone version of ComTrader. In the attached logs from ComTrader, I cannot confirm it, as it's not a full logs, and these details are missing.

For further investigation please provide the following details:
 # Impacted userID
 # Error message. Screenshot if possible
 # Full ComTrader logs for the whole day
 # approximate time window when it happened.

I walked through all attached logs but honestly I don't see any potential problem which could point to some kind of a bug in comtrader.

The only lines which could raise eyebrows are referring to lack of memory which resulted in the crash:
{code:java}
2020-04-19T09:01:10.165+0200 [oadcastListener] ERROR c.d.c.c.j.ComTrader - Comtrader-PrioritizingBroadcastListener

Comtrader logs shows among others the parameters of their workstation:
{code:java}
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2124G CPU @ 3.40GHz - 4 x 3408 
OS: Windows 10/10.0/x86
CT: 6.8.50.6/2020-04-03T12:22:34Z{code}
The line _Windows 10/10.0/x86_ refers to 32 bit Windows OS which means their ComTrader instance can use only 1GB of memory.

I recommend them to use 64 bit version of Windows which will allow them to utilize 6GB which will result in less crashes and faster responses.

I'm going to close this issue as _Not a bug_.

Why do you reopen this ticket? Do you think this is a bug in comtrader?

I have to reopen it.
Even though the deployment has been done successfully in PROD for EPEX and SEMOpx, it was not agreed to deploy the new ComTrader for FPROD so far for several reasons.
Nevertheless it was done without any notification towards EPEX.

This cause huge troubles on clients as well as EPEX side, as last Friday was supposed to be a member test day for M7 6.8 as this was just deployed in FPROD recently. This was also the reason why FPROD was not mentioned in my initial request.

I would like to remind you that every deployment need to be coordinated with EPEX.

It took a long time for investigation, the main problem is that we are not able to reproduce the issue. All our attempts to reproduce failed. If you know an easy way to reproduce the issue, please let us know.

Based on the above statement, we cannot tell you for sure on what is wrong, but we have a guess that this issue was resolved in 6,8. As the issue was reported in 6.7 and never re-occur in 6.8. Possibly it was resolved as a part of EPEXMT-2417, but again we cannot tell you for sure before we can reproduce the issue. I propose to close the ticket and re-open in case of re-occurrence.

Is it an issue with CXTREW20 userID? Or maybe some other UserID is impacted? I can see activity for this account all day yesterday and today. There was no activity only at 3 AM tonight. And I can see it was working yesterday at 14:00-15:00.

Please clarify, what do you mean by ""moved the application to a new business entity (API user)""?

 

According to normal investigation procedure, if the user has some issues with API, first check should be to login with impacted userID to ComTrader. It will help to understand if issue is related to customer API application or something is really wrong with account and required further investigation.

Yaroslav","05/Mar/20 16:38;jm.pournin@epexspot.com;Thanks Ivan,
I helped TRAILSTONE to investigate and the issue was on their side.
It was something in one of the libraries they use, causing a deadlock.  
There was no error generated, but it was blocking sending and receiving which made it appear that there was a connection issue.  
I close the issue.

Quick question:
1) Can you elaborate further on what the changes will be? The best info we have is in ticket SERVICE-5389:

""more memory to the reporting engine server (as the problem was caused by lack of memory)""
-> XG: OK, so by how much ( in FLOPS?) did you increase the memory?
""we log the synchronization process (the script sending reports to both reporting engine nodes)""
-> XG: sorry but what does it mean?

2) Our assumption is that the change will not result in an upgrade of RE (i.e. it will remain version 6.4.19) - is it correct?

Kind regards

Xavier","13/Mar/20 16:09;rehapav;[~dp007] can you take #1 here ?

ad 1 ) I have no idea why did we promiss in SERVICE-5389:

Hi Theo, Diana,

We've conducted investigation which resulted in the following:
 * more memory to the reporting engine server (as the problem was caused by lack of memory)
 * we log the synchronization process (the script sending reports to both reporting engine nodes)
 * we will monitor report generation soon and when the report is not in place at certain time it will raise alamr (I entered a ticket in our internal system)

Best regards,
Martin

ad 2) I can confirm version remains 6.4.19

 

 ","16/Mar/20 10:53;dp007;Hi Xavier,

I mentioned in the SERVICE-5389 that we conducted investigation which resulted in memory extension (technically we extented xmx on tomcat server Xmx4g => Xmx6g). This was done on Jan 29th. So prior to the upgrade.

Basically this has nothing to do with the deployment.

The synchronization process - it's a process which delivers reports to the slave node. As reporting engine runs on two nodes we have to distribute newly generated reports from one note to the second. This script does the synchronization. 

BR,
Martin","16/Mar/20 10:57;rehapav;ad 2) I can confirm version remains 6.4.19","17/Mar/20 18:15;x.guille@epexspot.com;Hi Martin

Thanks for the explanation.

1) Would you have a document explaining the design architecture of the Reporting Engine and how it interacts with the tomcat server ?

2) So I understand there has been a memory extension of 50% (from xmx 4GB to 6GB) - which is great. However, the quarterly growth of the TC540 size has been of 18.7% over the past 2 years. So I expect the memory increase of 50% DBAG delivered on 29/01 should be caught up sometime within Q4 2020... Do you agree with this analysis?

3) Re the synchro, what has changed after the fix? Was it running on 1 node before (and then synchronized to Node 2 ""slave"") and now it runs on 2 nodes simultaneously ? Sorry, I'm struggling a bit to understand what was the origin f the delay and what has changed now... Maybe it will be clearer if you can share a document (as referred to in point 1)

4) You also mentioned an ""alarm""
""we will monitor report generation soon and when the report is not in place at certain time it will raise alamr (I entered a ticket in our internal system)""
-> has it been set up yet on yr side? What time triggers the alarm? 

Kind regards

Xavier
","03/Apr/20 15:54;dp007;Hi Xavier,

ad 1) please see DFS190

ad 2) It's more complex - but yes, more memory will be required at some point of time, probably before the end of 2020, but we monitor the memory usage so we will be prepared well in advance.

ad 3) we haven't changed the synchronization process with the deployment.

ad 4) we are still polishing the alarm, the plan is to have ready by 14/4. It will check presence of the ADMIN TC540 at  4AM (but that's configurable and may change).

BR,
Martin","27/Apr/20 13:43;x.guille@epexspot.com;Hi Martin

I'm afraid DFS 190 does not contain the kind of information we are looking for:
what is RE architecture, what is the role of tomcat server in this architecture, where is it stated that the reports run on 1 node or 2 nodes, etc...

DBAG additionally reviewed the deployment process and introduces various enhancements in the process, that should prevent unexpected delays, especially then:

I do not mean the member activity reports, I mean the messages sent to the XBID EPEX users - so the communication between XBID and EPEX local. Please have a look at the referenced ticket below about the issue for your information.

If the data is too much, I can specify the period more: 8:30-10:10 on 17th and 19th February (high volume), and some calmer period as reference, like the previous week same times.

Thanks,

OK, sorry for the misunderstanding, I think it's more clear now.

Just a few things that we need to clarify:
 * since we forecast a very big file to be generated, do you have any preferred method to transfer it?
 *  when you mention ""_the messages sent to the XBID EPEX users - so the communication between XBID and EPEX local."",_ do you mean  all messages received by the SOB user (XBEPEXX1) ?
 * what would be the purpose of this file? Do you expect any specific format in the data?

Furthermore, since we're talking about a request out of the normal scope of support, of course it will have to be charged as additional package. Under this context, we would like to get the approval from EPEX that we should proceed. The estimated effort for this activity will be from 2 to 3 days. Approval can be done in this ticket by Samet Tunc.

Thank you.

I've checked both period, and cross-checked with our heartbeat tool, and can't find a pattern. This (and the fact that we have no report of any other issue in those particular periods), would most likely point to a network issue on the side of the user.

However, keep in mind that this week we are having considerable bigger load, specially during periods when XBID contracts/borders open. To mitigate this extra load, we already but in place this morning a new configuration change, that's suppose to handle this effort.

So, to finalize, I would suggest to wait 1 or 2 days in order to see if the occurrence isn't happening anymore. In parallel, i would also suggest the user to check on his side if there are any communications issue on his side.

I checked the statistics for the whole Sunday (8.2.) but I found only one peak *37.1s* at 16:00 for the rest of the day it was quiet.

Nonetheless please note that we already have several other jiras for this topic: SERVICE-4987 and SERVICE-5227 (Jean Marc) and others like SERVICE-5488.

The attached csv is full of _TraderAlreadyLoggedInExceptions_ which do mean that the user SXCJVP17 is trying to log into M7 whereas he's already logged in, seems like an implementation problem of their KQMZABP_0 application. This is not related to the rabbit performance problem.

I'm going to close this issue as duplicate because we are already covering this issue with other tickets and I don't want to keep multiple tickets related to one problem.

Each morning, the automatic export of trades via the Continuous Export csv (attached) locks and stops working. When I try to delete it (to force it to refresh it says it is locked up a Java user). The only way to release it is to log out of M7 and close it entirely. At this point I can delete the file, re-log into M7 and then the export is re-generated and everything work until the next morning.
 
This is very frustrating as I wastes time, but also as M7 doesn’t correctly save my screen layout, so each time I need to adjust it.
 
I have  attached the log files from M7 for you and can confirm the only system using your continuous export file is another excel sheet that imports it via excels data import functionality. To be clear if I shut my excel sheet, the continuous file still fails to update, so this is not the root cause of the error.

According to the ComTrader log file I see they are using very old version CT 6.6.100 which is not supported anymore. I highly recommend to upgrade to the latest version.

Besides that at the time when ComTrader tries to store the export file it crashes on _An unexpected network error occurred_ which is probably a result of storing the file on a network drive.

I would recommend to store the export file on a local hard drive.

Yes, the user CXRRPP09 is inactive since 2020-01-24, I also checked LDAP - his account is not present there. So from the application perspective he's gone.

However, as this user is still using valid certificate allowing him to get through HA PROXY to RabbitMQ, there is no way how to stop him. Basically Rabbit is kind of a frontline soldier which then either grants or revokes further access (depending on LDAP account and M7 user account). But everybody with valid cert can access it.

Basically this is a well known issue to us, please check this SERVICE-5379 ticket out. Xavier Guille is discussing the same topic there.

Justification
of the work: We
will be conducting a maintenance on our network to perform a software upgrade
on our Juniper Access Router SAR17.FRA located at Colt’s node in Frankfurt. The
new release includes bug fixes for a flap issue in the current code, and enables
Colt to move to the latest recommended release with continued vendor support.
First the team will upload the 64 bit Junos around the first 10 minutes of the
window, which will result in the BGP sessions to flap. The team will then
upgrade the backup routing engine. Once the backup routing engine has been
upgrade, traffic will be shifted to it from the primary routing engine which
will result in a 5 to 10 minute outage. This activity takes around 1 hour
inclusive of  monitoring the traffic. Once all stable, the team will
upgrade the primary engine and once complete, again shift traffic back,
resulting in a again in a 5 to 10 minutes outage.  Once again with
monitoring, it will take around one hour. After this, the team will perform 2
card reloads which  will cause a 15 minutes outage each, for all change to
be in effect. These actions should be completed within the first 7 hours of the
maintenance window, but we do quote an 8 hour window to cover all
eventualities. Back out plan: Our engineers reserve 60 minutes of the
maintenance window to roll the upgrade back to the current release should any
unforeseen difficulties occur during the work.""

Could you please confirm that the new Rabbit MQ server 3.8.1 version (compared to the current PROD version 3.7.6) does NOT require customers to upgrade their AMQP client version? 
Like for instance in .NET have to upgrade from 5.1.0 to 5.1.2 or whatever version supported by 3.8.1.
https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client/5.1.2

A customer raised that and then told us he made a mistake, his connectivity issues where only due to advsimu1 being unreachable (SERVICE-5481).
But this is a good opportunity to make sure that - though never mentioned by DBAG - no upgrade is required.

FYI we of course asked ALL customers to test their API app in ADV SIMU against M7 6.8.

It seems that something went wrong between the moment user CXPUES18 was deactivated by Market Ops in Jul 2019 in the Web GUI and the deletion in HAProxy in Sep 2019. Somehow, I assume the information failed to feed between the Back End and HA Proxy.

I started a high level architecture design to understand better the certification process - see attached. It was the 1st time we heard about HAProxy in the set up and the DFS180 do not refer to it (but however refers to an LDAP server).

In order for us to understand better the set up and also to prevent such issues to occur again, would you please kindly provide us some diagram and/or additional information on the set up or alternately, enrich the diagram I initiated?

Eventually, you mention 1st in your comment, 16/Oct/19 14:31: 'Please note the certificates are issued on user Level not on API level.'
 But on 08/Nov/19 14:43: ""I agree with you , from the above example there is one client certificate needed to connect API""

Which one is correct, then?

Thanks for your explanation - it's starting to make sense.
So is it correct to say that HAProxy checks:
1) existence of a certificate installed locally?
2) certificate not expired?

It does not check
3) user + password correct?

Also, when you mention ""a deactivated user"", do you mean in LDAP (C) or in Application (D)?

When you say a ""certificate (regardless it's valid or not)"" what do mean exactly? It must at least not be expired, correct?

From what I understand - but please correct me if I'm wrong - there is no way in current process and architecture to prevent a DDOS from occurring again...

So we need to identify what options (change of process, of architecture or mix of both) we have to prevent this type of event.

If you want, and if it makes things easier, you can call me on +33 1 73 03 62 75 so we can discuss further

","30/Jan/20 15:03;lw641;[~cv179] could you kindly help to answer new questions from Xavier?","07/Feb/20 11:41;lw641;Hi Xavier,

Please find responses below. Unfortunately, we don't provide a phone support. However, you can address these topics via PO/PM meeting as alternative to this ticket conversation, since your questions were about mostly about high-level designing and, I assume, some future development.

 
{code:java}
So is it correct to say that HAProxy checks:
1) existence of a certificate installed locally?
2) certificate not expired?
It does not check
3) user + password correct?
{code}
HAproxy checks for certificate's validity - sorry, I believe I didn't use the right word before.

To explain it further, certificate can be valid: in terms of issuer and expiration date. Expired certificate (past expiry date) will be not permitted by HAproxy, however certificate can be revoked by the issuer (even before it's expiry date). When certificate was revoked, HAproxy is currently *not* able to know that and will accept a connection from such user.

What does it mean? Theoretically, if a SSL certificate, +that is not expired+, was compromised and distributed to multiple endpoints - in such case, HAproxy still ""forwards"" connection attempts and thus allows the backend to be DDOS'ed.

Why backend might be under threat? As I've explained before:
{noformat}
user authentication via LDAP (C) is not a lightweight event and will consume <B> resources until auth. request <C> is completed on stages 2-3.{noformat}
Is there a mean to protect from this? Yes, ""easiest"" one, that has nothing to do with application design, would be [CRL|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list]. Basically, HAproxy will store a list of ""good"" certificates and every time connection is attempted it will go through the list and compare, *before* forwarding connection attempts further.

Why I took ""easiest"" in quotes? Because HAproxy is part of DBG-wide infrastructure and is outside of our control. It _might_ add certain limitations on what we can deploy there, which I haven't explored at the moment.

 

Another option _might be_ changing application design, so it somehow doesn't allow a user connecting with revoked certificate. Or treats a disabled account in a different way. Or some other way. Such questions (and request for change, if decided by EPEX) have to be discussed with our PO, Martin.

_What I believe issue here is not a risk of DDOS attack itself (I'm convinced EPEX won't get into situation of compromising someone's certificate, right?), but a misbehaving user that was disabled in application on purpose, however such user can still endanger backend (Y) by a storm of login attempts._

 

*To sum it up:*

1) There is currently no way of preventing a user with a revoked (but non-expired certificate) from reaching to M7 backend (Y);
 2) Protection can be done either via infrastructure change (starting on A, maybe B and / or C), change in application design (Y) or both;
 3) Either way would mean a change request from EPEX side to be taken into discussion with DBG Product Owner.

 

I hope I've answered your questions.

Do you have any member with another certificate from the same batch working (EPEX0422 to EPEX0451)? Just to eliminate hypothesis.

Also, would it be possible to get some logs from this member? (using the non working certificate, of course).

Thanks,

Hugo Correia","14/Jan/20 10:29;g.tsoukalas@epexspot.com;Hi hugo,

so far we have not use many of them.
Yesterday i have sent another one to a different member and if i get some information i will let you know.
We have requested the logs in the meantime, when we get them we will update the ticket.
At the same time could you please check on your side in order to save time?

","14/Jan/20 10:56;g.tsoukalas@epexspot.com;Dera Hugo,

same problem with EPEX0426 that has been provided to another member.
We think that there is an issue with the certificates.
please also check the expiration date (they should be valid until 2022 but they look like they are valid until October 2020","14/Jan/20 12:34;tj898;Hello again, [~g.tsoukalas@epexspot.com].

Ok, let me summarize out findings:
 * these certificates were generated 100% by us (no need for further middle-man anymore, from October onward we have control over their entire life-cycle, and we're able to distribute them much quicker). However, in order to have them working we still need to make an extra deployment to include our own CA in the certificate chain. Since there was no deployment since October in this environment, the newly generated certificates won't be able to authenticate and work).
 * So, we have 2 options here. Either we wait for the scheduled deployment to be executed (mid-February), or we ask a batch of 30 certificates to the old generation responsible team (this will take the normal 5 working days to be delivered) - please let me know the approach you prefer
 * validity of the new certificates (this bath of 30 that we are talking about) and the future ones will be 1 year. This can probably be changed (i think), but will have to be discussed separately

Hope everything is clear now. Sorry, i wasn't aware of this constrain with this last batch of certificates delivered in end October.

Please let us know on your decision. We'll act accordingly straight away.

Regards,

Hugo Correia

(DBAG Business Operations)","14/Jan/20 16:04;d.eichler@epexspot.com;Hi Hugo,

we would like to go for option 2: a new batch of certs with a validity of 3 years. Please see SERVICE-5348.
By coincidence we already opened a ticket for that as we found out hat the new certs are valid for only 1 year in parallel.

Please note, a validity of 1 year is operational wise not feasible and there cannot be accepted by EPEX MO.
