###  Masking and Unmasking Services #### 
'
Masking a service prevents an administrator from accidentally starting a 
service that conflicts with others. Masking creates a link in the configuration 
directories to the /dev/null file which prevents the service from starting.'


#systemctl mask sendmail.service
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sendmail.service â†’ /dev/null.


#systemctl start sendmail.service
Failed to start sendmail.service: Unit sendmail.service is masked.
