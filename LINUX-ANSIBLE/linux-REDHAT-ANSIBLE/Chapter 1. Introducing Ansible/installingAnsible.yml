''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''Managed Hosts:

One of the benefits of Ansible is that managed hosts do not need to have a special agent installed. The Ansible control node connects to managed 
hosts using a standard network protocol to ensure that the systems are in the specified state.



-> Linux and UNIX managed hosts need to have Python 2 (version 2.6 or later) or Python 3 (version 3.5 or later) installed for most modules to work.
#[root@host ~]# yum module install python36

-> If SELinux is enabled on the managed hosts, ensure that the python3-libselinux package is installed before using modules that are related to any copy, file, or template functions.
