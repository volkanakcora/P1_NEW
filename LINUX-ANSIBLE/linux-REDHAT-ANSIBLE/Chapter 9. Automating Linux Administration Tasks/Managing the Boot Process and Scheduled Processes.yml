Managing the Boot Process and Scheduled Processes



After completing this section, you should be able to manage service startup, schedule processes with at, cron, and systemd, reboot, and 
control the default boot target on managed hosts.



Scheduling with the at Module:

Quick one-time scheduling is done with the at module. You create the job for a future time to run and it is held until that time comes to execute. There are six parameters that come with this module. They are: command, count, script_file, state, unique, and units.

The at Module Example:
- name: remove tempuser.
  at:
    command: userdel -r tempuser
    count: 20
    units: minutes
    unique: yes

Appending Commands with the cron Module:

The cron module example:
- cron:
    name: "Flush Bolt"
    user: "root"
    minute: 45
    hour: 11
    job: "php ./app/nut cache:clear"



Parameter	                        Options	                                                             Comments
special_time   	reboot, yearly, annually, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly                        	A set of reoccurring times.
state	                        absent, present	                                   If set to present, it will create the command. Absent will remove it.
cron_file	                         Null                                             If you have large banks of servers to maintain then sometimes it is better to have a pre-written crontab file.
backup	                          yes, no	                                                 Backs up the crontab file prior to being edited.




Managing Services with the systemd and service Modules:

The service Module Example:
- name: start nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started"


The systemd Module Example:
- name: reload web server
  systemd:
    name: apache2
    state: reload
    daemon-reload: yes


The Reboot Module:

The reboot module Example:

- name: "Reboot after patching"
  reboot:
    reboot_timeout: 180

- name: force a quick reboot
  reboot:



The Shell and Command Module:


The shell module example:
- name: Run a templated variable (always use quote filter to avoid injection)
    shell: cat {{ myfile|quote }}

To sanitize any variables, It is suggested that you use {{ var | quote }} instead of just {{ var }}

The command module example:
- name: This command only
  command: /usr/bin/scrape_logs.py arg1 arg2
  args:1
    chdir: scripts/
    creates: /path/to/script
